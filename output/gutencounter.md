men and warriors of the several tribes of the New York Indians,
assembled in council; witnesseth;  "Whereas, The Six Nations of New
York Indians, not long after the close of the war of the Revolution,
became convinced, from the rapid increase of the white settlers
around, that the time was not far distant when their true interest
must lead them to seek a new home among their brethren in the West:
and,  "Whereas, This subject was agitated in a general council of the
Six Nations as early as 1810, and resulted in sending a memorial to
the President of the United States, inquiring whether the Government
would consent to their tearing their habitations, and removing into
the neighborhood of their western brethren, and if they could procure
a home there, by gift or purchase, whether the Government would
acknowledge their title to the lands so obtained in the same manner it
had acknowledged it in those from whom they might receive it; and
further, whether the existing treaties would in such a case remain in
full force, and their annuities be paid as heretofore: and,  "Whereas,
With the approbation of the President of the United States, purchases
were made by the New York Indians from the Menomonees and Winnebago
Indians of certain lands at Green Bay, in the Territory of Wisconsin,
which, after much difficulty and contention with those Indians
concerning the extent of the purchase, the whole subject was finally
settled by a treaty between the United States and the Menomonee
Indians, concluded in February, 1831, to which the New York Indians
gave their assent on the seventeenth day of October, 1832: and
"Whereas, By a provision of that treaty, five hundred thousand acres
of land are secured to the New York Indians of the Six Nations and the
St. Regis tribe, as a future home, on the condition that they all
remove to the same within three years, or such reasonable time as the
President shall prescribe, and  "Whereas, The President is satisfied
that various considerations have prevented those still residing in New
York from removing to Green Bay, and among other reasons, that many
who were in favor of emigration preferred to remove at once to the
Indian Territory; which they were fully persuaded was the only
permanent and peaceable home for all the Indians.

uncle Toby, any other date would have pleased me much better, not only

off our troops, and refusing to cover the siege of Quesnoi, though
Fagel was carrying on the works with such incredible vigour--but
likewise on the score, Trim, of thy own story; because if there are--
and which, from what thou hast dropt, I partly suspect to be the fact
--if there are giants in it--  There is but one, an' please your

this happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle Toby
discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my father's approaches
towards it, it instantly brought into his mind those he had done duty
in, before the gate of St. Nicolas;--the idea of which drew off his
attention so intirely from the subject in debate, that he had got his
right hand to the bell to ring up Trim to go and fetch his map of
Namur, and his compasses and sector along with it, to measure the
returning angles of the traverses of that attack,--but particularly of
that one, where he received his wound upon his groin.
