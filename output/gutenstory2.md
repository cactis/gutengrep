## <a id="chapter1">Chapter 1</a>

In training he had been, once upon a time, an engineer and built dams that broke and bridges that fell down and wharves that ftoated away in the spring floods\.

"There is moonlight\."

"Look at the moonlight\."

Unfortunately it was bright moonlight\.

With the moonlight scene opening this stanza, cp\.

And I sat by moonlight amid the necropolis of Memphis\.

With your guitar under the windows, of moonlight nights\!

They walked in the moonlight by the railings of the park\.

Blindman's buff was a great favorite for moonlight nights\.

I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight\.

On a moonlight night Flood Ireson was roused by knocking at his door\.

Black against the square of moonlight I saw him stagger, I saw him fall\.

Ah, darling," she said, "take me away from this horrible white moonlight\!

The stage is dark, but the lake and glaciers glisten in the moonlight\.

A ray of moonlight poured through the trees, and lighted up the face of the dead\.

He crossed to the other side of the street, and Farina followed out of the moonlight\.

The sweet charm of warm nights and of streams glittering in the moonlight penetrated us\.

Yonder in a space of moonlight on lush grass, the beams were as white fire to sight and feeling\.

After dinner we took a walk by moonlight, and I whispered all the tender things I could think of to her\.

I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day\.

Dunnoo, with his face ashy grey in the moonlight, implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once\.

No; moonlight was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head\.

As soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst into the room\.

I saw all the stone statues standing in the moonlight; and I myself was like one of those stone statues walking\.

In the obscured moonlight I supposed it was a native dog, but it was white, and looked exactly like a large fat lamb\.

Strolling in the cool moonlight, I was attracted by a brilliant light beneath the trees, and cautiously approached it\.

His images may be obscure, from the moonlight haze in which they float, but they are rarely so through faults of diction\.

Jack was standing in the middle of the stall, and by the moonlight Tip could see he was smiling just as jovially as ever\.

Look at the first movement, and judge whether there are not in it more pale moonlight reveries than fresh morning thoughts\.

Waternomee Falls, on Hurricane Creek, at Warren, are bordered with rich moss where fairies used to dance and sing in the moonlight\.

When Robin came out of the inn, he found young Richard Partington sitting upon his horse in the white moonlight, awaiting his coming\.

Its origin is due to Rellstab, who, in describing the first movement, drew a picture of a small boat in the moonlight on Lake Lucerne\.

John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wall\-paper till I felt creepy\.

Amidst the pastoral scenes, and under the tranquil moonlight of the New, the Old World, even in me, rude Bushman, claimed for a while its son\.

It was a very weird and desolate place; and everything looked dark and dismal, under the moonlight, as it streamed between stormy black clouds\.

"Mr\. Francis Osbaldistone," cries the girl's voice through the moonlight, "should not whistle his favourite airs when he wishes to remain undiscovered\."

Behind me lay the yard, vividly black\-and\-white in the moonlight, and the pile of wood and faggots on which Moreau and his mutilated victims lay, one over another\.

Finally, after studying the map carefully in the moonlight which now flooded the room, I pointed out a waterway far to the north of us which also seemed to lead to Helium\.

day; sunshine; light of day, light of heaven; moonlight, starlight, sun &c\. \(luminary\) 432 light; daylight, broad daylight, noontide light; noontide, noonday, noonday sun\.

Too capricious and imperious in all she does to be the cause of much surprise in those about her as to anything she does, this woman, loosely muffled, goes out into the moonlight\.

As I did so I saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge, and level, cacti\-studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of soft splendor and wondrous enchantment\.

Some of them, like \_Our Love is not a Fading Earthly Flower\_, \_O Moonlight Deep and Tender\_, \_To the Dandelion\_, and \_The First Snow\-Fall\_ are exquisite lyrics of nature and sentiment\.

And then the moonlight flooded the cave, and there before me lay my own body as it had been lying all these hours, with the eyes staring toward the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground\.

On the sword\-point gleams the moonlight, On the blade the sun is shining, On the hilt the bright stars twinkle, On the edge a horse is neighing, On the handle plays a kitten, On the sheath a dog is barking\.

"For the king, whose longing was excessive, could not be satisfied with devouring her form, which poured forth a stream of the nectar of beauty, as the partridge cannot be satisfied with devouring the moonlight\."

It was impossible to travel through this region at night, even by moonlight; we should have lost our eyes upon the sticks and branches of the direful scrubs if we had attempted it, besides tearing our skin and clothes to pieces also\.

The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and moth\.

In winter, when the ground is covered with snow, what grand times they have a slayin over these here mashes with the galls, or playin ball on the ice, or goin to quiltin frolics of nice long winter evenings and then a drivin home like mad, by moonlight\.

At length I arose, opened the window, and stood by it for some time in the clear moonlight, receiving, in part at least, that refreshment and dissipation of ideas from the clear and calm scene, without which they had become beyond the command of my own volition\.

Buddhism does not acknowledge the efficacy of prayers; and in the warm countries where Buddhists live, the occasional reading of the law, or preaching of the word, in public, can take place best in the open air, by moonlight, under a simple roof of trees or palms\.

Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics; propose to mat the deck; think of having hangings to the top; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle\.

You remember where we held That conversation;\-\-nay, we see the spot Even from this cypress;\-\-two long years are past Since, on an April midnight, underneath \_5 The moonlight ruins of Mount Palatine, I did confess to you my secret mind\.

Yellow mist Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank \_605 Wan moonlight even to fulness; not a star Shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds, Danger's grim playmates, on that precipice Slept, clasped in his embrace\.\-\-O, storm of death\!

"for waning beauty, Childhood vanished, youth departed, Silver sunshine, golden moonlight, Hope and pleasure of my childhood, Taken from me now forever, And so soon to be forgotten At the tool\-bench of my brother, At the window of my sister, In the cottage of my father\."

in my head; Then a Face came, blind and weeping, And It couldn't wipe its eyes, And It muttered I was keeping Back the moonlight from the skies; So I patted it for pity, But it whistled shrill with wrath, And a huge black Devil City Poured its peoples on my path\.

The upholsterer's where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and my bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near the window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him \(as I did one moonlight night\) leaning against the post and evidenfly catching cold\.

The day after the letter arrived in New Orleans, Susan and Emmeline were attached, and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the following morning; and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight which steals through the grated window, we may listen to their conversation\.

Not Miss Crawley\-\-she preferred her carriage\-\-but the walk over the Rectory fields, and in at the little park wicket, and through the dark plantation, and up the checkered avenue to Queen's Crawley, was charming in the moonlight to two such lovers of the picturesque as the Captain and Miss Rebecca\.

As we skirted along the coast, Wilson and I recognized, or thought we did, in the clear moonlight, the rude white Mission of San Juan Capistrano, and its cliff, from which I had swung down by a pair of halyards to save a few hides,\-\-a boy who could not be prudential, and who caught at every chance for adventure\.

And Philippe did collect all his forces, a great and noble army, and came one night to the hill of Sangate, just behind the English army, the knights' armor glancing and their pennons flying in the moonlight, so as to be a beautiful sight to the hungry garrison who could see the white tents pitched upon the hillside\.

The thread which the spiders had spun far over the seas, which her grandmother had sat in the moonlight and spun again for her, which she had tempered in the rose\-fire and tied to her opal ring, had left her \- had gone where she could no longer follow it \- had brought her into a horrible cavern, and there left her\!

Though Siddhartha fled from the self a thousand times, stayed in nothingness, stayed in the animal, in the stone, the return was inevitable, inescapable was the hour, when he found himself back in the sunshine or in the moonlight, in the shade or in the rain, and was once again his self and Siddhartha, and again felt the agony of the cycle which had been forced upon him\.

I had no horse, and the deep and wheeling stream of the river, rendered turbid by the late tumult of which its channel had been the scene, and seeming yet more so under the doubtful influence of an imperfect moonlight, had no inviting influence for a pedestrian by no means accustomed to wade rivers, and who had lately seen horsemen weltering, in this dangerous passage, up to the very saddle\-laps\.

They were all love, lovers, sweethearts, persecuted ladies fainting in lonely pavilions, postilions killed at every stage, horses ridden to death on every page, sombre forests, heartaches, vows, sobs, tears and kisses, little skiffs by moonlight, nightingales in shady groves, "gentlemen" brave as lions, gentle as lambs, virtuous as no one ever was, always well dressed, and weeping like fountains\.

went on to say, that from his window he had afterwards, and late at night, seen my aunt give this person money outside the garden rails in the moonlight, who then slunk away \- into the ground again, as he thought probable \- and was seen no more: while my aunt came hurriedly and secretly back into the house, and had, even that morning, been quite different from her usual self; which preyed on Mr\. Dick's mind\.

Madame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the continual silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings, she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone, which, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes, seemed like "moonlight on a statue," \-\- yielding light without warmth\.

A placid sea, which after much disturbance had sighed itself to rest, and a high, steady barometer promised a fifty hours' passage to Yokohama, and when Dr\. and Mrs\. Hepburn and I left Hakodate, by moonlight, on the night of the 14th, as the only passengers in the Hiogo Maru, Captain Moore, her genial, pleasant master, congratulated us on the rapid and delightful passage before us, and we separated at midnight with many projects for pleasant intercourse and occupation\.

Thou, O Ukko, art my father, Thou hast given me form and feature; As the sea\-gull on the ocean, As the duck upon the waters, Shines the Sun upon the swallow, Shines as bright upon the sparrow, Gives the joy\-birds song and gladness, Does not shine on me unhappy; Nevermore will shine the sunlight, Never will the moonlight glimmer On this hapless son and orphan; Do not know my hero\-father, Cannot tell who was my mother; On the shore, perhaps the gray\-duck Left me in the sand to perish\.

And perhaps some evening next spring, moved by a beam of moonlight falling through the branches on the grass at their feet, they will join and press their hands in memory of all this cruel and suppressed suffering; and, perhaps, also this short embrace may infuse in their veins a little of this thrill which they would not have known without it, and will give to those two dead souls, brought to life in a second, the rapid and divine sensation of this intoxication, of this madness which gives to lovers more happiness in an instant than other men can gather during a whole lifetime\!

\-\- Porpoises \-\- Alligators \-\- Silchar \-\- Tigers \-\- Rice crops \-\- Cookies \-\- Munniporees \-\- Hockey \-\- Varnish \-\- Dance \-\- Nagas \-\- Excursion to Munnipore frontier \-\- Elephant bogged \-\- Bamboos \-\- \_Cardiopteris\_ \-\- Climate, etc\., of Cachar \-\- Mosquitos \-\- Fall of banks \-\- Silhet \-\- Oaks \-\- \_Stylidium\_ \-\- Tree\-ferns \-\- Chattuc \-\- Megna \-\- Meteorology \-\- Palms \-\- Noacolly \-\- Salt\-smuggling \-\- Delta of Ganges and Megna \-\- Westward progress of Megna \-\- Peat \-\- Tide \-\- Waves \-\- Earthquakes \-\- Dangerous navigation \-\- Moonlight scenes \-\- Mud island \-\- Chittagong \-\- Mug tribes \-\- Views \-\- Trees \-\- Churs \-\- Flagstaff hill \-\- Coffee \-\- Pepper \-\- Tea, etc\.

Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the reader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes of the Salpetriere covered with snow and white as winding\-sheets in the moonlight, the taper\-like lights of the street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows of black elms, not a passer\-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and of darkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in the midst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single candle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M\. Leblanc tranquil, Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not losing a word, not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and pistol in hand\.

So the poor little cinder maid married the Prince, and in time they came to be King and Queen, and lived happily ever after\.

Once upon a time it happened that a man journeying from Elam arrived in Sodom toward evening\.

He asked: "Is Maitre Hauchecorne, of Breaute, here?"

Half an hour later somebody asked him, "Where's father?"

When asked what he brought, he professed skill in leechcraft\.

the latter asked, after returning his nephew's on\-duty salute\.

They asked for Dr\. Hall, and a page\-boy went in search of him\.

asked Catharine, blushing, "has he no message from the king to bring me?"

Polly asked no questions, but opened the door and held the lantern for him\.

On that day shall neither man nor djinn be asked of his sin: Which, etc\.

"But isn't it, possibly," Charlotte asked, "not quite enough to marry me for?"

She looked at the water and asked with surprise, "This is the water you drink?"

He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my bonnet, looking at me all the while\.

asked D'Artagnan, in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery\.

Then he accosted the youth and saluting him, asked him, "Why do I see my lord lone and lorn?

Kung\-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tsze\-kung, saying, 'From whom did Chung\-ni get his learning?'

He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing \_peculiar\_ at the scene of the atrocity\.

All the Plumstead party had of course been asked, at the time of the invitation Eleanor had intended to have gone with her sister\.

There was a crafty miller, and he Had lusty sons, one, two, and three: He called them all, and asked their will, If that to them he left his mill\.

In truth, but one thing now\-\-better have died Thrice than have asked it once\-\-could make me stay\-\- That proof of trust\-\-so often asked in vain\!

Have you ever noticed," asked Anne reflectively, "that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable?

Consequently, though I was the gendarme and therefore bound to apprehend him, I only asked him anxiously, when I reached him, if he had hurt himself very much\.

That the dainty maiden should dance and weep at the same time was indeed surprising; so Dorothy asked in a soft, sympathetic voice: "Are you unhappy, little girl?"

It was with this longing to repeat the few haunting notes that hummed in his brain that Nils went to the schoolmaster one day and asked him for the loan of his fiddle\.

Turning, he saw a circular disc reticulated with creases, and recognized the smiling countenance of the fat woman who had asked for another song at the Three Mariners\.

"Then," said the King, "you would have us fail of the faith which we pledged to the damsel, who asked you in marriage by way of guerdon for our restoration to health\."

I went near to one of them that stood by, and asked the truth of him concerning all these things, and he told me the interpretation of the words, and instructed me: 7:17\.

"Really now, in our own yard\- we asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them\.\.\.\. You know, I think, my dear\.\.\. let them be taken\.\.\. where's the hurry?"

He called upon the ladies the next day; he rode by their side in the Park; he asked their party to a great dinner at a restaurateur's, and was quite wild with exultation when they agreed to come\.

Thereupon Ghanim's heart sank and desire grew on him as its object offered difficulties; and he improvised these verses, "I asked the author of mine ills \* To heal the wound with one sweet kiss: No\!

asked the Badawi; and Ja'afar answered, "Take three ounces of wind\-breaths and the like of sunbeams and the same of moonshine and as much of lamp\-light; mix them well together and let them lie in the wind three months\.

"It's five\-and\-twenty pound, Mum," echoed that basest of swindlers, Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; "and it's no more than your merits \(as I said when my opinion was asked\), and I wish you joy of the money\!"

My father, seeing me downcast, asked to know the cause of my sadness, and I replied that I was suffering with my liver, but in truth I was mourning more than all my brethren, seeing that I had been the cause of Joseph's sale\.

So on the morn Sir Gawaine took his leave of his host Sir Carados, and rode into the forest; and at the last he met with Sir Pelleas, making great moan out of measure, so each of them saluted other, and asked him why he made such sorrow\.

He remembered he had not asked why she was not of the party in the morning, or where she was; he remembered he had not thought of her; and, from shame, he was ready to make any amends, the more so as he was about to plunge her into such acute grief\.

Gismondo’s wife, noticing my frequent presence in that house\-she was a lady as courteous as could be, and of surpassing beauty\-came up to me one day, looked at my drawings, and asked me if I was a sculptor or a painter; to whom I said I was a goldsmith\.

M\. Corvisart excused himself, asked the Emperor how he had been affected, what remedies he had used, and promised always to leave word where he could be found, in order that he might be summoned immediately on his Majesty's orders, and the Emperor was soon appeased\.

I have talked once or twice among ladies about principles and ideas, but they put their fans before their faces, and told me I was too wise for them, who for their part never pretended to read any thing but the play\-bill, and then asked me the price of my best head\.

So she opened the door and he entered and saluted her with the salam; whereupon she returned his salute and asked his need; and he replied, "The Lady Zubaydah, daughter of Al\-Kasim\[FN\#91\] and queen\-spouse of the Commander of the Faithful Harun al\-Rashid sixth\[FN\#92\] of the sons of Al\-Abbas, paternal uncle of the Prophet \(whom Allah bless and keep\!\)

Presently the Sovran of that capital came out and greeted them and asked them the cause of their coming; so they informed him of their adventures from commencement to conclusion; and he, when certified of the truth of this tale, returned to inform his daughter thereof\.\-\-And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say\.

Elder Perry Bradley left Carthage, Leek County, Mississippi, in January, 1880, and testifies to the following facts: "In October, 1879, twenty\-five or thirty masked men went into Peter Watson's house, and took him from his bed, amid screams of 'murder' from his wife and seven children; but the only reply the wife and children received at the hands of the desperadoes was a beating\.

On their way to the magistrate, Mr\. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr\. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him\.

That being done, he asked of Panurge the horoscope of his nativity, which was no sooner by Panurge tendered unto him, than that, erecting a figure, he very promptly and speedily formed and fashioned a complete fabric of the houses of heaven in all their parts, whereof when he had considered the situation and the aspects in their triplicities, he fetched a deep sigh, and said: I have clearly enough already discovered unto you the fate of your cuckoldry, which is unavoidable, you cannot escape it\.

44° 19' 36 N\. we observed Some Indians on a hill on the S\. S\. one Came to the river & fired off his gun and asked us to come he wish us to go to his Camp near at hand we refused, passed a large Island on the S\. S\., here we expected the Tetons would attempt to Stop us, and prepared for action, &c\. opposit this Island on the L\. S\. a Small Creek comes in, we call this Caution Island, Camped on a Sand bar 1/2 mile from the main Shore the wind hard from the N W\. Cold, the current of the river less rapid, & retains less Sediment than below\.

They were glad to face the end\.

He had saved an old nobleman's life once upon a time, and had been a good deal talked about on that score\.

But why commands the king That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, While he himself keeps in the cold field?

But why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain was just conceiving \.

But why castration should lead to the reappearance of an early condition of the horns cannot be explained with any certainty\.

But why, if you please, captain," asked Pencroft, knitting his brows, "why should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided?

But why did she say, 'We change countries,' and immediately flush, break and falter, lose command of her English, grow pale and swoon; why?

But why d'you s'pose I feel so\-\-so\-\-like I'd found something I'd missed and been looking for\-\-'s if this was the right place for me to fit in?

But why should man seek glory, who of his own Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation, ignominy, and shame\-\- Who, for so many benefits received, Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false, And so of all true good himself despoiled; Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take 140 That which to God alone of right belongs?

But if any fraud or treachery is practising against him, I hope that simple love and truth will be strong in the end\.



## <a id="chapter4">Chapter 4</a>

Once upon a time there lived a queen \-\- a powerful monarch \-\- who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe; and a minister; and this minister wished much to injure the queen, whom once he had loved too well\.

PRINCESS\.

\[To PRINCESS EBOLI\.

Command me, princess\!

Princess Mary did not answer\.

Princess: Admit them\!

Daryabar, History of the Princess of, iii\.

almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed\.

"The Princess Dunya, the King's daughter, is here\."

Why had that disgusting princess looked at my legs?

Princesse, ma parole, je n'ai pas voulu l'offenser\.

Don't mind Mr\. Joker," said the Princess to Dorothy\.

and the princess in danger of having her reputation hurt\!

Spice of the princess's conversation flavoured her speech\.

The princess demanded, 'O my minister, why do you come here?'

Not that I would intimate to you that princesses are purchaseable\.

Dang Wilapat bowed low And said, "Our greetings to thee, princess great\."

The princess had invited Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel\.

asked the princess, remembering first what had terrified her in the morning\.

Adi bin Zayd and the Princess Hind, v\. Ajib, The History of Gharib and his brother, vi\.

When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what Natasha's face had told her\.

Down to 1802, however, he always had a mass ready for Princess Esterhazy's name\-day in September\.

"Undoubtedly, for a woman of ordinary rank is noticed \-\- and with still greater reason a princess\."

I am happy for your sake," said Princess Mary, who because of those tears quite forgave Natasha's joy\.

Between Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long existed rather curious relations\.

At last, raising his eyes from his book, behold the princess, the nobles, and all the ton had disappeared\.

Replied the Princess, "By Allah, he hath dealt nobly in rebuilding it and hath done the deed of generous men\!

Hildebd: If Gama bring the Princess here, Give him good cheer, give him good cheer\.

Belli Ahmad said in his heart, "Thy name is Belli Ahmad, and shalt thou not see this beautiful Princess Nighara?

But the Princess had her fancy at last about that too; she was in the midst of a passage, before she knew it, between Father Mitchell and Charlotte\-\-some approach he would have attempted with her, that very morning perhaps, to the circumstance of an apparent detachment, recently noted in her, from any practice of devotion\.

These words be ill words," rejoined the Princess, "and Dame Zat al\-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest\.

Then he descended from the lofty gallery, His hand in the hand of the tall princess, And came to the door of the gold\-painted pavilion, And entered that royal assembly, Which blazed with light like the bowers of Paradise; And the slaves stood like houris before them: And Zal gazed in astonishment On her face, and her hair, and her stately form, and on all that splendor\.

Hear, Lord, my prayer; let not my soul faint under Thy discipline, nor let me faint in confessing unto Thee all Thy mercies, whereby Thou hast drawn me out of all my most evil ways, that Thou mightest become a delight to me above all the allurements which I once pursued; that I may most entirely love Thee, and clasp Thy hand with all my affections, and Thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation, even unto the end\.

Among the musicians who had been engaged for the Esterhazy service in 1779 were a couple named Polzelli\-\-the husband a violinist, the wife a second\-rate vocalist\.

His playing was full of fire and point, and his compositions had a great success in France, while his violin school had a wider vogue and considerably greater value\.

His shoulders were broad and strong, and though his limbs were hid by his cassock, his arms showed almost huge, and the violin lay tucked under his chin like a mere toy\.

When at last a soft sorrow crept across the violins, there came to him the vision of a far\-off home, the great eyes of his sister, and the dark drawn face of his mother\.

He sat beside her on the couch and behaved very well until the Polish violin\-teacher across the hall began to practise, when Prince would growl and sniff the air with disgust\.

The second violin is a Slovak, a tall, gaunt man with black\- rimmed spectacles and the mute and patient look of an overdriven mule; he responds to the whip but feebly, and then always falls back into his old rut\.

Having already been encouraged by the rector in Grottkau to cultivate his beautiful voice, he became in Breslau a chorister in one of the churches, and after some time was often employed as violinist and singer at the theatre\.

The CAPTAIN then proceeds as follows, his song being accompanied by a violin, generally played by the BESSY \- Six actors I have brought Who were ne'er on a stage before; But they will do their best, And they can do no more\.

Among the members of the Polish band\-\-which consisted of a leader \(Premier\), four violins, one oboe, two French horns, three bassoons, and one double bass\-\-we meet with such well\-known men as Johann Joachim Quanz and Franz Benda\.

He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the first violin: "Semen\!

Also it was Saturday night, and in a couple of hours would come a violin and a cornet, and in the rear part of the saloon the families of the neighborhood would dance and feast upon wienerwurst and lager, until two or three o'clock in the morning\.

So long as down the rocking floor The raving polka spins, So long as Kitchen Lancers spur The maddened violins, So long as through the whirling smoke We hear the oft\-told tale\-\- "Twelve hundred in the Lotteries," And Whatshername for sale?

Merk began his musical career as a violinist, but being badly bitten in the arm by a big dog, and disabled thereby to hold the violin in its proper position \(this is what Fetis relates\), he devoted himself to the violoncello, and with such success as to become the first solo player in Vienna\.

It may be compared, or rather contrasted, with another poem on the same subject which voices the despair in the heart of the French poet Verlaine, who hears "the sobbing of the violins of autumn": Les sanglots longs Des violons De l'automne Blessent mon coeur D'une langueur Monotone\.

Here another of the party introduces his companions by singing to a violin accompaniment, as follows: Here's two or three jolly boys, all in one mind; We've come a pace\-egging, \{44\} I hope you'll prove kind: I hope you'll prove kind with your money and beer, We shall come no more near you until the next year\.

The concert\- giver, a clever pianist and composer, who enjoyed in his day a good reputation in Germany, Russia, and Poland, produced at every matinee a new pianoforte concerto by one of the best composers\-\- sometimes one of his own\-\-and was assisted by the quartet party of Bielawski, a good violinist, leader in the orchestra, and professor at the Conservatorium\.

The activity of the society was great, and must have been beneficial; for we read that they had every Sunday performances of quartets and other kinds of chamber music, that ladies frequently came forward with pianoforte sonatas, and that when the celebrated violinist Moser, of Berlin, visited Warsaw, he made them acquainted with the finest quartets of Mozart and Haydn\.

From gay guitar and violin the silver notes are flowing, And the lovely lute doth speak between the trumpet's lordly blowing, And banners bright from lattice light are waving everywhere, And the tall, tall plume of our cousin's bridegroom floats proudly in the air: Rise up, rise up, Xarifa, lay the golden cushion down; Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the town\.

And it had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin\-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano\-part, multiform, coherent, level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight\.

Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin\-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it\-\-and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley\-\-the little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain\.

After dinner took coach and to my wife, who was gone before into the Strand, there to buy a nightgown, where I found her in a shop with her pretty girle, and having bought it away home, and I thence to Sir G\. Carteret's again, and so took coach alone, it now being almost night, to White Hall, and there in the Boarded\- gallery did hear the musick with which the King is presented this night by Monsieur Grebus, the master of his musick; both instrumentall\-\-I think twenty\-four violins\-\-and vocall; an English song upon Peace\.

She remembered how she\-\-wearing her low necked silk dress stained with wine, a red bow in her untidy hair, wearied, weak, half tipsy, having seen her visitors off, sat down during an interval in the dancing by the piano beside the bony pianiste with the blotchy face, who played the accompaniments to the violin, and began complaining of her hard fate; and how this pianiste said that she, too, was feeling how heavy her position was and would like to change it; and how Clara suddenly came up to them; and how they all three decided to change their life\.

I vividly recollect the time, the place, the persons, and even the temperature of the air, while the lively idea of a certain local impression peculiar to those times, transports me back again to the very spot; for example, all that was repeated at our meetings, all that was sung in the choir, everything that passed there; the beautiful and noble habits of the canons, the chasubles of the priests, the mitres of the singers, the persons of the musicians; an old lame carpenter who played the counter\-bass, a little fair abbe who performed on the violin, the ragged cassock which M\. le Maitre, after taking off his sword, used to put over his secular habit, and the fine surplice with which he covered the rags of the former, when he went to the choir; the pride with which I held my little flute to my lips, and seated myself in the orchestra, to assist in a recitative which M\. le Maitre had composed on purpose for me; the good dinner that afterwards awaited us, and the good appetites we carried to it\.

"I know that you will always be with me to the end\."



## <a id="chapter8">Chapter 8</a>

\`Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \`and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well\-\-' \`What did they live on?'

Poison" like these hell\-broths are part of the Witch or Obi stock\-in\-trade, and Frode uses powdered gold as an antidote\.

"But, at that time," said the Wizard, thoughtfully, "there were two Good Witches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land\."

What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East?

The people believed that on that evening and night the witches were abroad and busy casting spells on cattle and stealing cows' milk\.

That woman, who is a Witch of Satan's breed, hath disclosed to thy father all he sought to learn concerning this our dwelling\-place\.

The appearance of witches in the guise of birds was no unusual thing, indeed, and a farmer named Blakesley shot one of them in that form\.

Why go too then: Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake, He thought 'twas Witchcraft\.

It is for this reason solely that the witchcraft episode assumes historical importance, instead of being a side\-scene of ghastly picturesqueness\.

The Winged Monkeys You will remember there was no road\-\-not even a pathway\-\- between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City\.

A witch like Circe dost thou seem; For Circe could o'ercloud the sky; Oh, let the sun appear once more, And bid the clouds of darkness fly\!

Many young, and even old men, hearing of this \(our chief's\) offer, have traveled many miles to try their arrows on the witches, but all to no purpose\.

The noises recurred in 1888, when houses rattled in witch\-haunted Salem, eight miles away, and the bell on the village church "sung like a tuning\-fork\."

The witchery of the dawn turned the grey river\-reaches to purple, gold, and opal; and it was as though the lumbering dhoni crept across the splendors of a new heaven\.

"See," she said, and her face was set hard with cold and excitement, so that she looked a witch in the uproar; "would you not say the devil is loose now Angelo is abroad?"

Hereat the Witch again louted low and kissed the carpet under Peri\-Banu's feet, and took leave of her hostess in goodly phrase and with great show of gratitude for her favours\.

They think that the St\. John's fire keeps witches from the cattle, and they say that he who does not come to it will have his barley full of thistles and his oats full of weeds\.

\[FN\#430\] The enchanted pitcher does duty here for the witches' broomstick and the fairies' rush of European tales, but a similar conveyance is, I think, not unknown to Western folk\-lore\.

\[Illustration: HAWTHORNES BIRTHPLACE, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS\] John Hathorne, a son of the first settler, was a judge of the poor creatures who were put to death as witches at Salem in 1692\.

The witch\-doctors of the North made their camp on the northern rim of the island; those from the South settled along the southern edge, looking towards what is now the great city of Vancouver\.

As this creature is reckoned in our country a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play their pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted; and, in a violent fright, shrank under the bedclothes\.

Because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that was beautiful and agreeable, and that made use of witchcraft, that sold nations through her fornications, and families through her witchcrafts\.

Of course old Mombi had no intention of being found by Glinda; so, while her enemies were marching up the street, the witch transformed herself into a red rose growing upon a bush in the garden of the palace\.

Naturally enough the people who continued to burn his image came in time to identify it as the effigy of persons, whom, on various grounds, they regarded with aversion, such as Judas Iscariot, Luther, and a witch\.

So away home again, and there to my office to write my letters very late, and then home to supper, and then to read the late printed discourse of witches by a member of Gresham College,\-\-\[For belief in witches\.

\[FN\#264\] Blue eyes have a bad name in Arabia as in India: the witch Zarká of Al\-Yamamah was noted for them; and "blue eyed" often means "fierce\-eyed," alluding to the Greeks and Daylamites, mortal\-enemies to Ishmael\.

They mark him out as a lower kind of Saint Dominic, differing from the fierce and gloomy enthusiast who founded the Inquisition, as we might imagine the familiar imp of a spiteful witch to differ from an archangel of darkness\.

The spell of the enchanted forest is broken when the crowd invades its solitude; the witchery of moonlight fades into the light of common day; and then comes Theseus with his dogs to drive not the foxes but the fairies out of the landscape\.

In some districts they crown or gird themselves with mugwort while the midsummer fire is burning, for this is supposed to be a protection against ghosts, witches, and sickness; in particular, a wreath of mugwort is a sure preventive of sore eyes\.

In his multifarious reading he had become acquainted with all existing traditions and speculations concerning witchcraft, and his profession as minister in the Calvinist communion predisposed him to investigate all accessible details concerning the devil\.

The soldier first requires to be taken out of the well, and next the destruction of the old witch, after which he helps himself to the treasures in the hag's cottage, and goes off to the nearest town, where he puts up at the best inn and gets himself fine clothes\.

And this was the tribute paid by the American public to the master who had given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of witchery and mystery as "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "Ligea; such fascinating hoaxes as "The Unparalleled Adventure of Hans Pfaall," "MSS\.

LXXVII She had prepared the genial, fruitful bed, Under a broad pavilion; one more rich, Adorned, and jocund, never overhead \(Did this for peace or war its master pitch\) Was in the world, before or after, spread; And this from Thracian strand had borne the witch\.

I can quite understand that were 'Macbeth' produced for the first time before a modern London audience, many of the people present would strongly and vigorously object to the introduction of the witches in the first act, with their grotesque phrases and their ridiculous words\.

Faith stay heere this night, they will surely do vs no harme: you saw they speake vs faire, giue vs gold: me thinkes they are such a gentle Nation, that but for the Mountaine of mad flesh that claimes mariage of me, I could finde in my heart to stay heere still, and turne Witch Ant\.

XXXIX "Me my wife's words like poisoned weapon thrill, And pierce my suffering spirit through and through: Through bones and veins there went a deadly chill; My tongue clave to my throat: The witch withdrew With that the magic mantle, and at will Transformed me to mine ancient shape anew\.

While Jones was admiring these things, and Partridge sat trembling with the firm belief that he was in the house of a witch, the old woman said, "I hope, gentlemen, you will make what haste you can; for I expect my master presently, and I would not for double the money he should find you here\."

To suckle these "familiars" with the blood of a witch was forbidden in English law, which ranked it as a felony; but they were thus nourished in secret, and by their aid the witch might raise storms, blight crops, abort births, lame cattle, topple over houses, and cause pains, convulsions, and illness\.

The Ministers and Grandees now understood that the King was overwhelmed with woe, tearful\-eyed and heavy\-hearted by reason of the loss of Prince Ahmad; whereupon bethought the Grand Wazir of a certain witch famed for the Black Art who could conjure down the stars from heaven; and who was a noted dweller in the capital\.

This latter view is strongly supported by the testimony of the people who celebrate the fire\-festivals, since a popular name for the custom of kindling the fires is "burning the witches," effigies of witches are sometimes consumed in the flames, and the fires, their embers, or their ashes are supposed to furnish protection against witchcraft\.

I thought at first that she was a Gypsy, and addressing myself to her, inquired in Gitano if she were of that race; she understood me, but shaking her head, replied, that she was something better than a Gitana, and could speak something better than that jargon of witches; whereupon she commenced asking me several questions in exceedingly good Latin\.

I was myself once one of those; and if I heard talk of dead folks walking, of prophecies, enchantments, witchcrafts, or any other story I had no mind to believe: "Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas, Nocturnos lemures, portentaque Thessala," \["Dreams, magic terrors, marvels, sorceries, Thessalian prodigies\."

Upfloated night, and darkened earth and air; Then feasted they before that cliff\-like wall, Ceteian men and Trojans: babel of talk Rose from the feasters: all around the glow Of blazing campfires lighted up the tents: Pealed out the pipe's sweet voice, and hautboys rang With their clear\-shrilling reeds; the witching strain Of lyres was rippling round\.

Seeks the mother to detain him, Thus the anxious mother answers: "Do not go, my son beloved, Ignorant of Pohya\-witchcraft, To the distant homes of Northland Till thou hast the art of magic, Till thou hast some little wisdom Do not go to fields of battle, To the fires of Northland's children, To the slaughter\-fields of Lapland, Till of magic thou art master\.

As these sibyls thrust forth their grey heads, imperfectly covered with close caps of flannel, and showed their shrivelled brows, and long skinny arms, with various gestures, shrugs, and muttered expressions in Gaelic addressed to each other, my imagination recurred to the witches of Macbeth, and I imagined I read in the features of these crones the malevolence of the weird sisters\.

Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep, When I recall to mind those once lov'd names, Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop, With Traversaro's house and Anastagio s, \(Each race disherited\) and beside these, The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease, That witch'd us into love and courtesy; Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts\.

Before those cruel Twins, whom at one birth Incestuous Change bore to her father Time, \_50 Error and Truth, had hunted from the Earth All those bright natures which adorned its prime, And left us nothing to believe in, worth The pains of putting into learned rhyme, A lady\-witch there lived on Atlas' mountain \_55 Within a cavern, by a secret fountain\.

Then, as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination,\-\-the moan of the whip\-poor\-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that harbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost\.

They lived in a cave or cell, made out of a rock; it was divided into several apartments, one of which Prospero called his study; there he kept his books, which chiefly treated of magic, a study at that time much affected by all learned men: and the knowledge of this art he found very useful to him; for being thrown by a strange chance upon this island, which had been enchanted by a witch called Sycorax, who died there a short time before his arrival, Prospero, by virtue of his art, released many good spirits that Sycorax had imprisoned in the bodies of large trees, because they had refused to execute her wicked commands\.

Here's a fable I draw from a Naturalist's book, and we'll set it against the dicta of Jenny Do\-nothing, Jenny Discretion, Jenny Wait\-for\- the\-Gods: Once upon a time in a tropical island a man lay sick; so ill that he could not rise to trouble his neighbours for help; so weak that it was lifting a mountain to get up from his bed; so hopeless of succour that the last spark of distraught wisdom perching on his brains advised him to lie where he was and trouble not himself, since peace at least he could command, before he passed upon the black highroad men call our kingdom of peace: ay, he lay there\.

We'll go back now\.

We naturally ask why\.

We always call it yours\.'

"We've left the women behind\."

We reached the port\.\-\-Alas\!

We are the flower, Thou the sun\!

We still say "with might and main\."

We have a very formidable adversary\.

We need your donations more than ever\!

We move into the Hall after Christmas\.

We need your donations more than ever\!

We tread the path where Fate hath led, i\.

We closed this year with sad forebodings\.

We will descend, and fold him in our armes\.

"We have led such a solitary life\-\-no one\."

We are all weak creeturs,' said Mr\. Bumble\.

We dressed hurriedly and ran to the upper deck\.

We might as well do it as sit here doing nothing\.

We can't talk here," she said, stepping back a moment\.

"We must go back to Paris, father, I feel entirely well\."

We are trustees and responsible stewards in the spending\.

We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it\.

We locked both doors, and saw poor Nan, as I thought, \(but, oh\!

We are going to be married soon," said Clare, with improvised phlegm\.

We shall find them in the town And we'll take them in and comfort them\.

We had less than a thousand men as escort, and never thought of danger\.

We seldom study the condition of the Negro to\-day hon\- estly and carefully\.

We agree with Lord Mahon in thinking highly of the Whigs of Queen Anne's reign\.

We may easily bring it to the simplest of all possible forms, a pure despotism\.

We have probably nothing equal to it in the present quiet operations of nature\.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones that have responded\.

We arrived here on Sunday, the 1st of August, and both parties left again on the 4th\.

We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth\.

We likewise possess two very singular fragments of the private correspondence of the senators on this occasion\.

We had good organization, good men, but no cohesion, no real discipline, no respect for authority, no real knowledge of war\.

We did so, promptly, and as nearly every man in camp was included, we fell in as for other purposes, by hundreds and thousands\.

We got out in that direction about twenty miles, passed near a hill I named Mount Scott\*, and found a small creek, but no water\.

We rode in by the same way as we had come out the evening before, all four of us\-\- the men and the horses\-\-wearied and jaded\.

We can not embarrass or cut off the trade of France without at the same time in some degree embarrassing or cutting off our own trade\.

We must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law\-abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime\.

We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill\.

We lifted Mr\. Trelawny on to the sofa where he had lain yesterday; and, having done what we could for him, turned our attention to the Nurse\.

We have but one way to avoid them\-\-that of acknowledging a common head of our church, whose word on all points of doctrine shall be authoritative\.

We have his associate's testimony that Tacitus made a most eloquent and dignified reply to the arguments which were urged on the part of the defence\.

We had turned off the road, and were making our way up the hill, when, looking in the direction of Holdernesse Hall, I saw a cyclist coming swiftly along\.

We were, as I was later to learn, nearing the edge of one of Mars' long\-dead seas, in the bottom of which my encounter with the Martians had taken place\.

We yield ourselves to your absolute will and pleasure, in order to save the remainder of the inhabitants of Calais, who have suffered much distress and misery\.

We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity\.

We had no other law than a kind of moderated passion; no other civil power than an honest mob; and no other protection than the temporary attachment of one man to another\.

We fled from him right and left and he saw us not, for his sight was altogether blent; but we were in terrible fear of him and made sure we were dead men despairing of escape\.

\* \[We collected seven men's loads of this superb plant for the Royal Gardens at Kew; but owing to unavoidable accidents and difficulties, few specimens reached England alive\.

We seek to establish those material conditions of life in which, without exception, men may live in dignity, perform useful work, serve their communities, and worship God as they see fit\.

We were extremely fortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships and privations, we located the most remarkable gold\-bearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured\.

We see, too, why Temple dwelt so much on the private wealth of the members, why he instituted a comparison between their united incomes and the united incomes of the members of the House of Commons\.

We, too, rely on his goodness, on his goodness as manifested, not in extraordinary interpositions, but in those general laws which it has pleased him to establish in the physical and in the moral world\.

We once found a tree in a village, with many pieces of the bark chipped off, closely allied to the Tangena or Tanghina, the ordeal poison tree of Madagascar; but we could not ascertain any particulars about it\.

We have said that Mr Closerstil was accompanied by a learned friend of his, one Mr Romer, a barrister, who was greatly interested in Sir Roger, and who, being a strong Liberal, was assisting in the canvass with much energy\.

We see from the foregoing how much the objective nature of War makes it a calculation of probabilities; now there is only one single element still wanting to make it a game, and that element it certainly is not without: it is chance\.

We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd In England and in Ireland; not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention: but of that to\-morrow; When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly\.

We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O our brother, O Hasan," replied they and binding chin\-veils, armed themselves and slung on their swords: after which they brought Hasan a steed of the best and equipped him in panoply and weaponed him with goodly weapons\.

We should avail ourselves of the present lull to secure the strategical points that will give us an advantage in the future military movements, and we should treat the idea of civil government as one in which we as a nation have a minor or subordinate interest\.

We are glad to help in any movement for international peace, but this is because we sincerely believe that it is our duty to help all such movements provided they are sane and rational, and not because there is any tendency toward militarism on our part which needs to be cured\.

We could not understand this erection of fortifications on that side, because, knowing as we did how well the flanks of the City were protected by the Savannah and Ogeeche Rivers, we could not see how a force from the coast\-\-whence we supposed an attack must come, could hope to reach the City's rear, especially as we had just come up on the right flank of the City, and saw no sign of our folks in that direction\.

Her soul went out to the Unseen Pity that would be with her to the end\.

If we should lay the loss we have sustained in the number of those who have gone astray, in the balance against the benefit we have had by being again put in breath, and by having our zeal and strength revived by reason of this opposition, I know not whether the utility would not surmount the damage\.

If a botanist found this state of things in a new plant, I imagine he might be inclined to think that his tree was monoecious, that the flowers were of different sexes, and that, so far from setting up a barrier between the branches of the tree, the only hope of fertility lay in bringing them together\.

If what we call evil and torment is neither evil nor torment of itself, but only that our fancy gives it that quality, it is in us to change it, and it being in our own choice, if there be no constraint upon us, we must certainly be very strange fools to take arms for that side which is most offensive to us, and to give sickness, want, and contempt a bitter and nauseous taste, if it be in our power to give them a pleasant relish, and if, fortune simply providing the matter, 'tis for us to give it the form\.

If the colony continues increasing, it will become necessary to augment the number of the representatives, and that the interest of every part of the colony may be attended to, it will be found best to divide the whole into convenient parts, each part sending its proper number; and that the ELECTED might never form to themselves an interest separate from the ELECTORS, prudence will point out the propriety of having elections often; because as the ELECTED might by that means return and mix again with the general body of the ELECTORS in a few months, their fidelity to the public will be secured by the prudent reflection of not making a rod for themselves\.

Once upon a time, the Foxes were angry with Sun\.

said Basil, with seven\-year\-old scorn\.

He was a ten\-year\-old priest and politician\.

"you are as hearty as a three\-hundred\-year\-old oak\."

The three\-year\-old grew too ambitious in his fierceness\.

for I addressed them as I would a group of ten\-year\-old boys\.

Hold the horse, Willy," said Mrs\. Moss to the twelve\-year\-old boy\.

But I'm going to walk and it's too far for your eight\-year\-old legs\.

We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12\-year\-old, Tyrone Ford\.

The love stories are read by fat cigar drummers and little ten\-year\-old girls\.

"And I\-\-I always have remained the\-\-the widow of this thirteen\-year\-old boy\."

Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year\-old nephew\.

When she snarled her displeasure, the old leader would whirl on the three\-year\-old\.

The house had an air of colonial self\-respect that impressed even a nine\-year\-old child\.

"Well, my dear aunt, some of them appear old and others ugly, thanks to their ten\-year\-old fashions\."

The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen\-year\-old officer\.

We cannot renew this country when 13\-year\-old boys get semi\-automatic weapons to shoot 9 year olds for kicks\.

The three\- and four\-year\-old holluschickie romped down from Hutchinson's Hill crying: "Out of the way, youngsters\!

The janitor's five\-year\-old daughter was playing on the steps' Hopkins gave her a nice, red rose and walked up\- stairs\.

Now he was not even the same as when she had left him; he was still further from the four\-year\-old baby, more grown and thinner\.

He had fixed his eyes admiringly on a coal\-black, four\-year\-old mare, a mere colt, which brought up the rear of the procession\.

Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two\-hundred\-year\-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage\.

Margaret disliked babies, but hit it off better with the two\-year\-old, and sent Dolly into fits of laughter by talking sense to him\.

Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you couldn't expect a six\-year\-old child to know things like that by instinct\.

Keith, the proprietary governor, took satanic pleasure in offering to purchase a printing outfit for the eighteen\-year\-old boy, to make him independent\.

She sat behind the stove on the bedshelf, and pretended to catch a fat four\-year\-old boy, who ran backwards and forwards in front of her, laughing gaily\.

The wreath is dedicated in church on the following Sunday; and on Easter Eve the grain is rubbed out of it by a seven\-year\-old girl and scattered amongst the young corn\.

The mother stooped over the first cot, in which a two\-year\-old little girl lay peacefully sleeping with her little mouth open and her long, curly hair tumbled over the pillow\.

Both of these young men aided in the saving of Mrs\. William T\. Graham, wife of the president of the American Can Company, and Mrs\. Graham's nineteen\-year\-old daughter, Margaret\.

Mr\. Apthorp told of his own similar struggle, and how he had entered a public school and sat for months with ten\-year\-old\-boys, reciting their lessons and catching their phrases\.

The 68\-year\-old President stood outside for the entire proceeding, greeted crowds of well\-wishers at the White House later that day, and attended several celebrations that evening\.

He thought it natural that the Government should send him out as an adventurer also, with a twenty\-three\-year\-old son, and he did not even notice that he left not a friend behind him\.

It was a symptom of alienation between Henry and his wife that the six\-year\-old son of Elizabeth Blount was at the same time created Duke of Richmond and Lord High Admiral, with much pomp\.

COLONEL ASTOR John Jacob Astor was returning from a trip to Egypt with his nineteen\-year\-old bride, formerly Miss Madeline Force, to whom he was married in Providence, September 9, 1911\.

When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a three\-year\-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat\.

"Sure me fawther got a goold medal \(and his Excellency himself eat a slice of it, and said never was finer mate in his loif\) for a four\-year\-old heifer, the like of which ye never saw in this country any day\."

Bagheera gave him half a dozen love\-taps from a panther's point of view \(they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs\), but for a seven\-year\-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could wish to avoid\.

If you purchase for nursery row planting, six\-foot to seven\-foot two\-year\-old apple trees, of the standard sorts, should cost you about thirty cents each; one\-year "buds," six feet and branched, five to ten cents less\.

We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being taken\-\-when St\.\-Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the mort\-\-crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two\-year\-older\.

There was one lanky three\- year\-old pine\-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a "Vauxhall," which was in reality a drinking\-bar where tea too was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it\.

The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray\-haired or bald seventy\-year\-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing boston at the clubs\.

All experience since the creation of man, all divine revelation or human science, conspired to deceive and betray a twelve\-year\-old boy who took for granted that his ideas, which were alone respectable, would be alone respected\.

Nineteen\-year\-old Sanchez did not indeed care for her hand, but merely for her love, and when it began to grow dusk, he stationed himself on the balcony which he had discovered, made signs to her, and flung flowers or bonbons on her table\.

And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten\-year\-old creatures\-\-instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die\.

When the year had come to an end, he took great pains to reconcile Biorn and Ane, who had often challenged and fought one another, and made them exchange their hatred for friendship; and even entrusted to them his three\-year\-old son, Olaf, to rear\.

Dismissing this, however, she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the daytime, in company with her nine\-year\-old brother Abraham, and her sister Eliza\-Louisa of twelve and a half, call "'Liza\-Lu," the youngest ones being put to bed\.

said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful with his fifty\-year\-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside\.

The grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty\-year\-old heels, and began to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more: "Ainsi, bornant les cours de tes revasseries, Alcippe, il est donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries\.

There on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one containing some of her three\-year\-old homemade currant wine for which she was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort, Mrs\. Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it\.

She was much better fitted for the task than Marilla, for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive understanding of the curious ideas that seven\-year\-olds sometimes get about matters that are, of course, very plain and simple to grown up people\.

Let's work together to meet these three goals: every eight\-year\-old must be able to read, every 12\-year\-old must be able to log on to the Internet, every 18\-year\-old must be able to go to college, and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime\.

CHAPTER XV JACK THAYER'S OWN STORY OF THE WRECK Seventeen\-year\-old son of Pennsylvania Railroad official tells moving story of his rescue\-\-Told mother to be brave\-\-Separated from parents\-\- Jumped when vessel sank\-\-Drifted on overturned boat\-\-Picked up by Carpathia\.

Next to him sat a University student who was coaching him, and Missy's cousin, Michael Sergeivitch Telegin, generally called Misha; opposite him, Katerina Alexeevna, a 40\-year\-old maiden lady, a Slavophil; and at the foot of the table sat Missy herself, with an empty place by her side\.

I have seen twelve\-year\-old boys working in chains on the public streets of Atlanta, directly in front of the schools, in company with old and hardened criminals; and this indiscriminate mingling of men and women and children makes the chain\-gangs perfect schools of crime and debauch\- ery\.

Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger\-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three\-year\-olds who thought they could\.

Both sexes of the wild turkey are ultimately furnished with a tuft of bristles on the breast, but in two\-year\-old birds the tuft is about four inches long in the male and hardly apparent in the female; when, however, the latter has reached her fourth year, it is from four to five inches in length\.

What "still the same" might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an unnoticed glance at little seven\-year\-old Nicholas, who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and swaying, came to a stop\.

The Mikados of Japan seem early to have resorted to the expedient of transferring the honours and burdens of supreme power to their infant children; and the rise of the Tycoons, long the temporal sovereigns of the country, is traced to the abdication of a certain Mikado in favour of his three\-year\-old son\.

Thus the important thing for the Protector was more emphatically than before to conciliate France and gain over a strong party in Scotland to support the policy of friendly relations with England; whereof the chief corner stone was still the marriage of Edward who was about ten years old to the four\-year\-old Queen of Scots\.

As for bluff Sir William Phips, he is better remembered for his youthful exploits of hoisting treasure from the fifty\-year\-old wreck of a Spanish galleon, in the reign of King James, and of building with some of the proceeds his "fair brick house, in the Green Lane of Boston," than for his administration of government during his term of office\.

Meanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna Mikhaylovna's son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest son; Sonya, the count's fifteen\-year\-old niece, and little Petya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces\.

Their wives never came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two\-, three\-, and four\-year\-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green thing that grew\.

Worst of all, the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law in Boston \-\- the sight of Court Square packed with bayonets, and his own friends obliged to line the streets under arms as State militia, in order to return a negro to slavery \-\- wrought frenzy in the brain of a fifteen\-year\-old, eighteenth\-century boy from Quincy, who wanted to miss no reasonable chance of mischief\.

Since then, this Congress – across party lines – and the American people have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation – expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8\-year\-olds can read\.

But had sunk to climb on a firmer footing By nature incapable of asking pardon Cajoled like a twenty\-year\-old yahoo at college Careful not to smell of his office Challenged him to lead up to her desired stormy scene Chose to conceive that he thought abstractedly Consciousness of some guilt when vowing itself innocent Consign discussion to silence with the cynical closure Convictions we store\-\-wherewith to shape our destinies Convincing themselves that they impersonate sagacity Could not understand enthusiasm for the schoolmaster's career Could we\-\-we might be friends Curious thing would be if curious things should fail to happen Death is only the other side of the ditch Death is always next door Desire of it destroyed it Detestable feminine storms enveloping men weak enough Didn't say a word No use in talking about feelings Distaste for all exercise once pleasurable Divided lovers in presence Enthusiasm struck and tightened the loose chord of scepticism Enthusiast, when not lyrical, is perilously near to boring Exult in imagination of an escape up to the moment of capture Few men can forbear to tell a spicy story of their friends Greatest of men; who have to learn from the loss of the woman Having contracted the fatal habit of irony He had to shake up wrath over his grievances He had gone, and the day lived again for both of them He gave a slight sign of restiveness, and was allowed to go He loathed a skulker He took small account of the operations of the feelings He began ambitiously\-\-It's the way at the beginning Her vehement fighting against facts Her duel with Time His aim to win the woman acknowledged no obstacle in the means His restored sense of possession Hopeless task of defending a woman from a woman How to compromise the matter for the sake of peace?

By little and little the water fell away, so that in ten year after that, a second knot was made, and you must unwind so much rope, or the bucket swung tight and empty at the end\.

Once upon a time there lived at Simla a very pretty girl, the daughter of a poor but honest District and Sessions Judge\.

Suddenly he got up\.

Suddenly his face cleared\.

Suddenly my sleep had gone\.

Suddenly he jumped to his feet\.

Suddenly Messala turned to him\.

Suddenly she uncovered her eyes\.

Suddenly Catharine raised her head\.

Suddenly the duke's window grew bright\.

Suddenly something stirred, beside him\.

Suddenly I felt a voice saying\-\-"Ungrateful\!"

Suddenly a Fat Gentleman's coach stops the way\.

Suddenly, he found that the money was still in his hands\.

Suddenly out upon the night air rang the cry of a crane\.

Suddenly, however, he heard her voice, faintly: "Jurgis\!

Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window\.

Suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch\.

Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without, came\-\-fear\.

Suddenly resolute, she rushed downstairs, and tremblingly stood before him\.

Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time\.

Suddenly put down among boys of my own age, I found I had a great deal to learn\.

Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go\.

Suddenly and imperceptibly the reader finds himself elevated from a trivial scene\.

Suddenly, a strange concert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket\.

Suddenly we came upon the Professor linked arm\-in\-arm with\-\-Sir Adolphus Cordery\!

Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows\.

Suddenly the music of the Grosvater dance struck up, and every one rushed from the table\.

Suddenly her eye fell upon the sprawling frame of Billali, and she seemed to recollect herself\.

Suddenly the King exclaimed, ''Tis the wrath of Shagpat that his assailants remain uncastigated\!'

Suddenly Hanssen sang out that he saw something funny in front \-\- what it was he did not know\.

Suddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes said sweetly, "Would none of you like a cup of tea?

Suddenly, as though bereft of his senses, he moved forward, staggering helplessly, towards the table\.

Suddenly she seized his head between her hands, kissed him hurriedly on the forehead, crying, "Adieu\!"

Suddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over me, shortly afterwards adding another to my covering\.

Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, the wheels half emerged from the ruts\.

Suddenly the child asked, in a voice of unconcern: 'Do you think my father's going to die, Miss Brangwen?'

Suddenly I thought of what would happen if she discovered me, and the reflection made me turn sick and faint\.

Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word "Arise\!"

Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee\-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air\.

Suddenly I regained consciousness, and called out to Felice to drive away the old man on the moment, who kept tormenting me\.

Suddenly, Jali almost disappeared from the saddle as he leaned forward with a jerk and seized a fine young buffalo by the tail\.

Suddenly, therefore \-\- and as if by the hand of magic \-\- this whole valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible\.

Suddenly Michel, taking a spring, left the floor and remained suspended in the air, like Murillo's monk of the \_Cusine des Anges\_\.

Suddenly the old man, stricken at heart, forgot a passage, and his voice groped in agony, like a blind man at a fair for his lost leader\.

Suddenly I heard the dining\-room echo to a merry peal of laughter from Valentina Ignatievna, and the General reply to that outburst: "'Ah, that man\!

Suddenly she saw a handsome door; so she opened it and found herself in a flower\-garden finer than the first\-\-ne'er saw eyes of seer a fairer than it\.

Suddenly the beast extended its arms, or rather legs, and inclosed him in a grasp that might have vied with the far\-famed power of the "bear's hug" itself\.

Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface\.

Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off\.

Suddenly a shot was heard and then another, a long way off; and for four hours they heard from time to time near or distant reports and rallying cries, strange words of challenge, uttered in guttural voices\.

Suddenly, on one of the officers' saying that it was humiliating to look at the French, Rostov began shouting with uncalled\-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the officers: "How can you judge what's best?"

Suddenly some one known to us falls\-\-a shell strikes amongst the crowd and causes some involuntary movements\-\-we begin to feel that we are no longer perfectly at ease and collected; even the bravest is at least to some degree confused\.

Suddenly the rumour spread about that Cesare, the pope's second son, was the author of the deed, and although the inquiries then ceased and no conclusive evidence has yet come to light, there is every probability that the charge was well founded\.

Suddenly there swept down from a bluff above us, on the Georgia side, a mingling of shout and roar and rattle as of a tornado let loose; and as a storm of bullets came pelting against the sides of the vessel, and through a window, there went up a shrill answering shout from our own men\.

Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb\.

Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous palace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of jacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is still more rare\.

Suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged by the shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, now intersected by the back road of the farm of Mont\-Saint\-Jean; a retrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself, Wellington drew back\.

Suddenly she that rode upon his left Clung to the shield that Lancelot lent him, crying, 'Yield, yield him this again: 'tis he must fight: I curse the tongue that all through yesterday Reviled thee, and hath wrought on Lancelot now To lend thee horse and shield: wonders ye have done; Miracles ye cannot: here is glory enow In having flung the three: I see thee maimed, Mangled: I swear thou canst not fling the fourth\.'

Suddenly wakened with a sound of talk And laughter at the limit of the wood, And glancing through the hoary boles, he saw, Strange as to some old prophet might have seemed A vision hovering on a sea of fire, Damsels in divers colours like the cloud Of sunset and sunrise, and all of them On horses, and the horses richly trapt Breast\-high in that bright line of bracken stood: And all the damsels talked confusedly, And one was pointing this way, and one that, Because the way was lost\.

It reminded them of the enchanted forest in "Undine," through which a man might ride forever without finding the end\.

They seem never to have been a warlike race; passing through their country, we once observed a large stone cairn, and our guide favoured us with the following account of it:\- "Once upon a time, our forefathers were going to fight another tribe, and here they halted and sat down\.

"Why?"

"Why?"

"Why?"

Why not?

Why not?

Why not?

"Why not?"

"Why not?"

Why is this?

Why, sweet\.

Why do you cry?'

Why was I ashamed?

Why this agitation?

Why am I not free?

Why, my pretty youth?

Why does she say that?

Why, I do,' said Kit\.

Why is this door locked?

Why, what shall I learn?

Why should Tamenund stay?

Why is there competition?

Why, goodness gracious\!

"Why did you come, then?"

Why are you out so late?'

Why, we didn't expect you\!

Why twinned be we tweyne?"'

Why, then are you no maiden\.

"Why did you look at the sunset?"

Why should you conceal it from me?

\`Why, where are you off to, Ratty?'

Why, let's tell them we will not go\!

"Why has this been sent to my house?"

Why, just FOR that: to get her away\.

Why, you know not,' said Mr\. Creakle\.

"Why don't your children come in, Bessy?"

"Why, the grottos \-\- caves of the island\."

"Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?"

Why not blow it away with a breath of your lips?

Why, you wouldn't break both their hearts now?'

"Why didn't he let me be there instead of Tikhon?"

Why cling you at my heels Like an infernal spirit\!

Why with some little Traine, My Lord of Buckingham?

Why should a child have less instinct than an animal?

"Why do you want to put me under such terrible obligations?"

"Why, take you from this place, and carry you away with me abroad\."

Why on earth then do you allow tea\-cake to be served up for your guests?

Why, you might fall in love with the Lord Chancellor himself by that time\!

"Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn't you?"

Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafes\.

Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?

Why, you had not very much time for talk," her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes\.

Why, even now some of the biggest stars can't go to some towns because they always cop it there\.

Why, Kate,' said Nicholas, drawing his sister towards him and kissing her, 'let me see your face\.

"Why, it seems that his crime is a lasting one, and, consequently, his punishment ought to be so, too\."

Why, they'll tear my cloth for me," she went on, looking at them from a distance, her strainer in her hand\.

Why 'tis no matter man, if they did heare They would not marke me: oh if they did heare They would not pitty me\.

Why was this, or why was all mention of any field of duty for the head of the army left out of the army regulations?

Why, you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be writhing all the time\.

"Why, then, my Rane," asked the boy, "may we not cut our way out through that lowland fen, to the open sea and liberty?"

Why, I have known him, of course, since I could know anything; but I have never yet discovered what my father does like\.

\-\-"Why, measter," cries the fellow, "you must be come out of your road the Lord knows whither; for thick way goeth to Glocester\."

Why, my boys have been to Cincinnati, with five hundred dollars' worth of colts, and brought me back the money, all straight, time and agin\.

Why, it's to swear false oaths\!\-\- unless it's possible for a woman to slip out of herself and be another person after a death like that of a love like hers\.'

Why, I know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat of a little boy of eight, because he couldn't endure the jokes he made every day at table\!

Why, very well: I telling you then, if you be remember'd, that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you,\-\- FROTH\.

Why is it that when you awake to the world of realities you nearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has carried with it some enigma which you have failed to solve?

"Why, for my part, on the contrary, I should have taken special care to preserve megatheriums and pterodactyles, and all the antediluvian species of which we are unfortunately deprived by his neglect\."

Why did I bring you to this poor, cold little place, on a night like this, when you might have been at River Bank by this time, toasting your toes before a blazing fire, with all your own nice things about you\!'

Why, here begins his morning story right: These two Antipholus', these two so like, And these two Dromios, one in semblance,\-\- Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,\-\- These are the parents to these children, Which accidentally are met together\.

In the third row; fourth from the end\.

He goes on to relate how, once upon a time, a wicked Jew bewitched the prophet Mohammed himself by tying nine knots on a string, which he then hid in a well\.

"And then?"

"And then?"

And then the heat\.

And then she said "Oh\!"

\`And then "MOME RATHS"?'

And then Robert goes off\.

And then they went in and took possession of the house\.

And then the King cried: Where are my knights and my men?

And then I'll get a drinking with the landlord and his kin\.

And then you'd know what he was: he was a great sea\-captain\.

And then the present emergency came on for serious discussion\.

And then the travelling tent was taken down and the sledges packed\.

And then there was the dog\-harness, which we must all have in order\.

And then came to her mind those curious questions; what makes a gentleman?

And then that laughed and twirled that's tail till you couldn't hardly see it\.

And then they dressed their shields, and came running together with great ire\.

And then, when he arose of his swoon, he cried out sorrowfully, and said: Alas\!

And then the will of Louis XIV was not respected; it is likely that mine would be?

"And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell me what you think\."

\`And then he took the helmet off again\-\-but it took hours and hours to get me out\.

And then, Lycas will be sure to want to visit a sick passenger, as part of his duties\!

And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow\.

And then hear thou in heaven their prayers, and their supplications, and do judgment for them\.

"And then, instead of comforting me, you leave me entirely in the wrong, and completely in the lurch\."

And then I shewed her your kind letter; and she made a thousand remarks upon it, and made me wish I had not\.

And then, did it not occur to you that once Miss Porter knew the truth she would break her engagement with Clayton?

And then for pity Sir Launcelot withheld his knights, and suffered King Arthur's party for to withdraw them aside\.

And then came Sir Dinadan with a spear, and he smote Sir Launcelot such a buffet that horse and all fell to the earth\.

And then she stopped, to fancy how the noise would sound inside, and how gently it would seem to die away upon the ear\.

And then Mr Toogood had only written one short scrap of a letter\-\-just three words, and they were written in triumph\.

And then, on rendering his soul to the devil, he would recommend Anne of Austria to make me the inhabitant of a safe place\.

And then, as to Campbell's interest with Morris, I incline to suppose that it must have been gained by playing upon his fears\.

And then he ordered his horses, affirming they should reach Baptista's house by dinner\-time, for that it was but seven o'clock\.

And then he sells me my house at an advanced price, and I buy, and then he votes against a penny for the protection of the shore\!

And then the Martian beside us raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report that made the ground heave\.

And then a theme I had never heard crept in, and caught my ear at once, because it was quite new to me, and so marvellously sweet\.

And then I left my wife to go home by coach, and I walked to the Temple about my law business, and there received a subpoena for T\. Trice\.

And then suddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his man, rode their way into the forest, that no man perceived where they went\.

And then sets to work to persecute him, because he has blood in his veins, because he worships beauty; because he seeks a real marriage, a real mate\.

And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before\.

And then he was gone again into the swaying trees, following the high\-flung spoor which no other human eye could have detected, much less translated\.

And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty mountain\-top in a dream\.

And then," she had said, "it isn't of course a question of anything expensive, gorged with treasure as Maggie is; it isn't a question of competing or outshining\.

And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head\.

And then, also, the old\-fashioned phaeton, of old\-fashioned old Dr Century was seen to rumble up to the big house, and it became known that Lady Arabella was not very well\.

And then they made a feast in honour of the goddess on the Mount of Bears, singing the praises of Rhea most venerable; but at dawn the winds had ceased and they rowed away from the island\.

"And then," said somebody else, "then there was Petit Gaillard, who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb\."

And then King Arthur was wood wroth, and ran to the King with the Hundred Knights, and there King Arthur smote him down; and after with that same spear King Arthur smote down three other knights\.

And then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh ones spring up, which are akin to them, and because he, their father, does not know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous\.

And then proceeding to his operation, "Sir," said he, "since I have dealt in suds, I could never discover more than two reasons for shaving; the one is to get a beard, and the other to get rid of one\.

And then when it was past noon, and when it drew toward evensong, Sir Gawaine's strength feebled, and waxed passing faint that unnethes he might dure any <130\>longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger\.

And then he hurl'd into the night alone, Wailing unto the spirit of his son, That somewhere in dark mist and sighing wind Must dwell, nor yet to Hades had it won, Nor quite had left the world of men behind\.

And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs\. Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed\.

And then had these three kings great cheer of King Leodegrance, that thanked them of their great goodness, that they would revenge him of his enemies; and there had Arthur the first sight of Guenever, the king's daughter of Cameliard, and ever after he loved her\.

And then this passing discriminative power was withdrawn, and Jude was lost to all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure, that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto unsuspected, though it had lain close beside him\.

And then turning towards the mills he said aloud, "Friends, whoe'er ye be that are immured in that prison, forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for some other knight\."

And then, when thou hast heedfully sought the grace of the goddess, retreat from the pyre; and let neither the sound of feet drive thee to turn back, nor the baying of hounds, lest haply thou shouldst maim all the rites and thyself fail to return duly to thy comrades\.

And then came the farmer, a good\-like sort of man, grave, and well\- behaved; and spoke to me in such sort, as made me a little pacified; and seeing no help for it, I went in; and the wife immediately conducted me up stairs to the best apartment, and told me, that was mine as long as I staid: and nobody should come near me but when I called\.

And then, with one of those extraordinary transitions of which I have already spoken, she again threw off her veil, and broke out, after the ancient and poetic fashion of the dwellers in Arabia,\[\*\] into a pæan of triumph or epithalamium, which, wild and beautiful as it was, is exceedingly difficult to render into English, and ought by rights to be sung to the music of a cantata, rather than written and read\.

And thence to White Hall, and there staid in Mr\. Wren's chamber with him, reading over my draught of a letter, which Mr\. Gibson then attended me with; and there he did like all, but doubted whether it would be necessary for the Duke to write in so sharp a style to the Office, as I had drawn it in; which I yield to him, to consider the present posture of the times and the Duke of York and whether it were not better to err on that hand than the other\.

And then, with small adventure met, Sir Bors Rode to the lonest tract of all the realm, And found a people there among their crags, Our race and blood, a remnant that were left Paynim amid their circles, and the stones They pitch up straight to heaven: and their wise men Were strong in that old magic which can trace The wandering of the stars, and scoffed at him And this high Quest as at a simple thing: Told him he followed\-\-almost Arthur's words\-\- A mocking fire: "what other fire than he, Whereby the blood beats, and the blossom blows, And the sea rolls, and all the world is warmed?"

And then we all up to the Duke of York, and there did our usual business, and so I with J\. Minnes home, and there finding my wife gone to my aunt Wight's, to see her the first time after her coming to town, and indeed the first time, I think, these two years \(we having been great strangers one to the other for a great while\), I to them; and there mighty kindly used, and had a barrel of oysters, and so to look up and down their house, they having hung a room since I was there, but with hangings not fit to be seen with mine, which I find all come home to\-night, and here staying an hour or two we home, and there to supper and to bed\.

Nor had he only proposed to himself the end\.

No, sir,' said he, 'I hear nothing,' and he laughed\.

Farina laughed, but answered, 'Look, you of the Club\!

He laughed low: a sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered\.

Damn it all, I don't want to be interesting," laughed Philip\.

She can blow him up as well as shine on him," laughed Laurie\.

He danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed\.

He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge\.

He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed\.

At this, the Bishop glared like an angry cat, while even Sir Richard laughed; only Robin kept a grave face\.

Then evil was the end of the evil doers; because they had treated our signs as lies, and laughed them to scorn\.

She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even repeated after Biddy, the words "Pip" and "Property\."

Thomas Seymour laughed, and did not consider it worth his while to defend himself against the accusations of the fool\.

The surprise among those who had brought in this seemingly young dancer was so great that no one laughed, no one said a word\.

And a thousand caricatures of children, angels, owls, fools, and child\- sized butterflies laughed and mocked, and roared at me\.

She nodded, and then uttered some rapid words, glanced at him, laughed shyly, and sank her features into repose as we drew near\.

Hurried counsel rage and craft Yelped to hungry men, whose teeth Hard the grey lip\-ringlet gnawed, Gleaming till their fury laughed\.

Dear me, it doesn't seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child\.

Charlotta, who would probably have obeyed if Miss Lavendar had told her to stand on her head, climbed upon the stone bench and laughed loud and heartily\.

Then home he returned when the wager was lost, With sorrow of heart, I may say; The lady she laughed to find her love crost, \- This was upon midsummer\-day\.

As the examination proceeded I cast a glance at Thurid and startled him looking wide\-eyed and wonderingly at me, and then of a sudden he laughed full in my face\.

Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his hole very funny indeed\.

But the soldier began to suspect something, be mistrustful, and when they laughed too loud he would roll his eyes uneasily, and sometimes they lighted up with anger\.

Some laughed at the "scholars," and went over the other side of the forecastle, to work, and spin their yarns; but I carried the day, and had the cream of the crew for my hearers\.

It wasn't fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied\.

CLER: O, by no means, she may not refuse\-\-to stay at home, if you love your reputation: 'Slight, you are invited thither o' purpose to be seen, and laughed at by the lady of the college, and her shadows\.

His good\-nature soon put her at her ease; and although she still denied the charge, she laughed so heartily at it, that Nicholas had the satisfaction of feeling assured that in all essential respects it was strictly true\.

Once in the street, moved by some secret impulse, he laughed, and held his sides, and laughed again, and tried to peer through the dusty area railings as if to catch another glimpse of the child, until he was quite tired out\.

Hereupon the youth laughed aloud and cried, "By Allah, thy son hath not suffered aught from the shifts and changes of the World, and he is still in the bonds of life, safe and sound; nor hath there befallen him anything of harm whatever\."

The expression of deluded subjects is become so hacknied and contemptible, and the more so when we see them making prisoners of whole armies at a time, that the pride of not being laughed at would induce a man of common sense to leave it off\.

In front of the door a clucking hen was scratching in the dust with a brood of chickens about her heels, the sparrows were chattering of household affairs under the eaves, and all was so sweet and peaceful that Little John's heart laughed within him\.

In a word, I confess my own weakness; I was willing that they should continue my debtors, and have little doubt that they had not the slightest objection to remain so; they kept their money, and probably laughed in their sleeves at my want of common sense\.

Emilia, though she thought it natural that Braintop should carry a pocket\-mirror if he pleased, laughed from sympathy; until Braintop, reduced to the verge of forbearance, stood up and remarked that, to perform the mission entrusted to him, he must depart immediately\.

After Ragnar had thus triumphed the king scanned his dress closely, and saw that he was rough and hairy; but, above all, he laughed at the shaggy lower portion of his garb, and chiefly the uncouth aspect of his breeches; so that he gave him in jest the nickname of Lodbrog\.

they laughed, and death was in the midst of them; they laughed, and the gates of the Tower were already opened to admit one of those merry guests of the king into that house which no one in those days of Henry the Eighth left again, save to go to the stake or to ascend the scaffold\!

However it was, he rode beside her and rejoiced to hear the young girl's talk of her father as a captain of one of England's thunderers, and of the cruelty of that Admiralty to him: at which Admiral Baldwin laughed, but had not the heart to disagree with her, for he could belabour the Admiralty in season, cause or no cause\.

But it was no use; she was ill\-content while her father and others called him buccaneer and filibuster, and she joyed that old William Drayton, who had ever spoken well of the young Frenchman, laughed at their insults, saying that he was as brave, comely, and fine\- tempered a lad as he had ever met, and that the capture of the forts was genius: "Genius and pith, upon my soul\!"

Rebecca passed that night in constant watching upon Miss Crawley; the next night the old lady slept so comfortably, that Rebecca had time for several hours' comfortable repose herself on the sofa, at the foot of her patroness's bed; very soon, Miss Crawley was so well that she sat up and laughed heartily at a perfect imitation of Miss Briggs and her grief, which Rebecca described to her\.

This being one of the standing jokes between the old fellows and Tim, they all three laughed very heartily, and might have laughed much longer, but that the brothers, seeing that Mrs Nickleby was labouring to express her feelings, and was really overwhelmed by the happiness of the time, took her between them, and led her from the room under pretence of having to consult her on some most important arrangements\.

At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards\-\-she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions\.

When I was in France, I heard from one Dr\. Pena, that the Queen Mother, who was given to curious arts, caused the King her husband's nativity to be calculated, under a false name; and the astrologer gave a judgment, that he should be killed in a duel; at which the Queen laughed, thinking her hus\- band to be above challenges and duels: but he was slain upon a course at tilt, the splinters of the staff of Montgomery going in at his beaver\.

She even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the dinner\-guests laugh and shout over; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut, where, of course, it didn't fit and hadn't any point; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way, while I could see that she was wondering to herself why it didn't seem as funny as it did when she first heard it\.

He laughed me in the face, and said: “Wait and see, Benvenuto; for by the time that you have finished that work of yours, I will make haste to have finished this vase, which I took in hand when you did the jewel; and then experience shall teach you what profit I shall get from my vase, and what you will get from your ornament\.” I answered that I was very glad indeed to enter into such a competition with so good a craftsman as he was, because the end would show which of us was mistaken\.

I will take care of what Curdie thinks of you in the end\.

Quoth she, "Not so, 'tis Ali the Cairene, whom the Jew Azariah hath enchanted;" and she turned to the dog and said to him, "Art not Ali of Cairo?"

The whole sky is blue, the fields are green, the houses all white, and our enchanted eyes drink in those bright colors which bring delight to our souls\.

7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said\.

To humble, alas, each too\-haughty emotion That swelled my proud breast, from the foam of the ocean Fair Venus arose, to enchant gods and men\!

It was Flordelis, whose lover, Florismart, as we have related, had met the fate of Orlando and many more, and fallen a victim to the enchantress of the cup\.

LV If she had been in that enchanted hold, She might before have seen the cavalier Wandering with Bradamant, Rogero bold, Gradasso and Ferrau and Brava's peer\.

Nor is the day of love for ever dead, When young enchantment and romance are gone; The veil is drawn, but all the future dread Is lightened by the finger of the dawn\.

And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons, and of diviners, who mutter in their enchantments: should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead?

It was my turn to stand at the foremast\-head; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air\.

In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him\.

And ofttimes Merlin would have had her privily away by his subtle crafts; then she made him to swear that he <103\>should never do none enchantment upon her if he would have his will\.

Stand now with thy enchanters, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast laboured from thy youth, if so be it may profit thee any thing, or if thou mayst become stronger\.

She began to think her muteness lost her the bloom of the enchantment, robbing her of her heavenly frolic lead, since friend Matey resolved to be as eminently good in salt water as on land\.

As a result of the enchantment Jellia took on the form and features of Mombi, while the old witch grew to resemble the girl so closely that it seemed impossible anyone could guess the deception\.

When the enchanter saw her prostrate he made his horse alight on the ground, and, dismounting, fixed the shield on the pommel of his saddle, and approached in order to secure the fallen warrior\.

Examine not, O child of man\!\-\-examine not that mysterious melancholy with the hard eyes of thy reason; thou canst not impale it on the spikes of thy thorny logic, nor describe its enchanted circle by problems conned from thy schools\.

On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king's son came and cried: 'Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair to me\.'

He soon met with a weeping damsel, who, being questioned as to the cause of her sorrow, told him she was in search of one to do battle to rescue her lover, who had been made prisoner by a vile enchantress, together with Orlando and many more\.

"To that we answer you," said he of the Mirrors, "that you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether you are the said person or not\."

In this short interval Don Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea's enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don Alvaro into fresh amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho he went his way, and Don Quixote went his\.

She smiled with unspeakable sweetness, and said there would be no want of opportunities, provided I could maintain the good opinion her brother had conceived of me, and I, enchanted by her charms, seized her hand, which I well nigh devoured with kisses\.

\(29\) "The word \`Thessala' was a common one in Latin, as meaning \`enchantress', \`sorceress', \`witch', as Pliny himself tells us, adding that the art of enchantment was not, however, indigenous to Thessaly, but came originally from Persia\."

"Hearken, for this concerneth thee: he made a tale of me of true and false mingled, that I was a wise\-wife and an enchantress, and my lord trowed in him, so that I was put to shame before all the house, and driven forth wrung with anguish, barefoot and bleeding\."

When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, "I have now come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world?

Now, he was roiled by the enchantments of the Queen, caught in the snare of her beguilings; and he let her lead him to a seat beside her on the throne, and sat there awhile in the midst of feastings, mazed, thinking, 'What life have I lived before this, if the matter be as I behold?'

I was in a great state of anxiety about the water supply, and Tietkens and I walked first after the horses, and then took them up to the glen, where I was enchanted to behold the stream again in full flow, and the sheets of surface water as large, and as fine as when we first saw them yesterday\.

Uct Dealv went then to the house of Fergus Fionnliath, and she broke the enchantment that was on the hound, so that Tuiren's own shape came back to her; but in the matter of two small whelps, to which the hound had given birth, the enchantment could not be broken, so they had to remain as they were\.

She had to check fancies drawn from Arabian tales, concerning the help sometimes given by genii of the air and enchanted birds, that were so incessant and vivid that she found herself sulking at the loneliness and helplessness of the visible sky, and feared that her brain was losing its hold of things\.

Don John, as in his Moorish disguise he had looked upon her perfections, had felt in danger of becoming really the slave he personated\-\-"her beauty is more divine than human," he had cried, "but fitter to destroy men's souls than to bless them;" and now the enchantress was on her way to his dominions\.

She that doth call me husband, even my soul Doth for a wife abhor; but her fair sister, Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace, Of such enchanting presence and discourse, Hath almost made me traitor to myself: But, lest myself be guilty to self\-wrong, I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song\.

Two or three individuals hinted that the man of skill, during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests, who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters, often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art\.

"All these mishaps have befallen thee, hardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and God grant thy squire Sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that dearly beloved Dulcinea of thine may never be released from her enchantment, that thou mayest never come to her bed, at least while I who adore thee am alive\."

"It is a good joke for your worship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the Royal Council, as if they were people who would allow such a lot of lies to be printed all together, and so many battles and enchantments that they take away one's senses\."

By God, gentlemen," said Don Quixote, "so many strange things have happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have sojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively in reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my belief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment\.

Then again they sought a singer, Magic minstrel, beer\-enchanter, Thus to praise the drink of heroes, Sing the songs of joy and gladness; And a boy was brought for singing; But the boy had little knowledge, Could not praise the beer in honor; Children's tongues are filled with questions, Children cannot speak in wisdom, Cannot sing the ancient legends\.

Yet the philosopher who trembles at the idea of such distant catastrophes may console himself by reflecting that these gloomy apprehensions, like the earth and the sun themselves, are only parts of that unsubstantial world which thought has conjured up out of the void, and that the phantoms which the subtle enchantress has evoked to\-day she may ban to\-morrow\.

She had to lock herself in her room for an hour of deadly abandonment to misery, resembling the run of poison through her blood, before she could bear to lift eyes on her friend; to whom subsequently she said: 'Emmy, there are wounds that cut sharp as the enchanter's sword, and we don't know we are in halves till some rough old intimate claps us on the back, merely to ask us how we are\!

Miranda, who thought all men had grave faces and grey beards like her father, was delighted with the appearance of this beautiful young prince; and Ferdinand, seeing such a lovely lady in this desert place, and from the strange sounds he had heard, expecting nothing but wonders, thought he was upon an enchanted island, and that Miranda was the goddess of the place, and as such he began to address her\.

All under foot was fresh grass, in Syria the rarest and most beautiful production of the soil; if he looked up, it was to see the sky paley blue through the groinery of countless date\-bearers, very patriarchs of their kind, so numerous and old, and of such mighty girth, so tall, so serried, so wide of branch, each branch so perfect with fronds, plumy and waxlike and brilliant, they seemed enchanters enchanted\.

A Form most like the imagined habitant Of silver exhalations sprung from dawn, By winds which feed on sunrise woven, to enchant The faiths of men: all mortal eyes were drawn, \_2110 As famished mariners through strange seas gone Gaze on a burning watch\-tower, by the light Of those divinest lineaments\-\-alone With thoughts which none could share, from that fair sight I turned in sickness, for a veil shrouded her countenance bright\.

Not knowing any more whether time existed, whether the vision had lasted a second or a hundred years, not knowing any more whether there existed a Siddhartha, a Gotama, a me and a you, feeling in his innermost self as if he had been wounded by a divine arrow, the injury of which tasted sweet, being enchanted and dissolved in his innermost self, Govinda still stood for a little while bent over Siddhartha's quiet face, which he had just kissed, which had just been the scene of all manifestations, all transformations, all existence\.

And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I never spoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to be envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of the rogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity, always natural and never acted; and if I had no other merit save that I believe, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and all the holy Roman Catholic Church holds and believes, and that I am a mortal enemy of the Jews, the historians ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their writings\.

"And thou, highest perfection of excellence that can be desired, utmost limit of grace in human shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart that adores thee, though the malign enchanter that persecutes me has brought clouds and cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them only, transformed thy unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into those of a poor peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same time changed mine into those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy sight, refuse not to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing in this submission that I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the humility with which my soul adores thee\."

SECOND FAUN: 'Tis hard to tell; I have heard those more skilled in spirits say, \_70 The bubbles, which the enchantment of the sun Sucks from the pale faint water\-flowers that pave The oozy bottom of clear lakes and pools, Are the pavilions where such dwell and float Under the green and golden atmosphere \_75 Which noontide kindles through the woven leaves; And when these burst, and the thin fiery air, The which they breathed within those lucent domes, Ascends to flow like meteors through the night, They ride on them, and rein their headlong speed, \_80 And bow their burning crests, and glide in fire Under the waters of the earth again\.

For myself I can say that since I have been a knight\-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous, well\-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my faith, senor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree; and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith without works is dead\.

Thou hast forgotten, O Sancho, those lines of our poet wherein he paints for us how, in their crystal abodes, those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which the ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were worked and woven with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort must have been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only that the spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes all those things that give me pleasure, and turns them into shapes unlike their own; and so I fear that in that history of my achievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author was some sage who is an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for another, mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relating transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history\.

In the abyss of evil into which I am plunged, I feel the blows reach me, without perceiving the hand by which they are directed or the means it employs\.

Where an exact copying makes our pictures less striking, we choose the less evil; deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth, than beauty\.

And you also have done worse than your fathers: for behold every one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil heart, so as not to hearken to me\.

And now it is done; now for thee I loose my virgin zone; and come storm, come shine, come good, come evil, come life, come death, it never, never can be undone\.

By dwelling on the sanctity of human life, Christianity did its best to repress the very common practice of suicide as well as the frightful evil of infanticide\.

But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil\.

In connection with the fight he bore also the names, "annihilator of the enemy," "rooter out of all evil," "troubler of the evil ones," "life of the whole of the gods\."

Or, to again employ the figure, evil is the product of incest between adverse powers; good will sooner or later be the legitimate child of their holy and mysterious union\.

As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because of, and so far as, its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity\.

Especially if there was anything discreditable to be found out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and if he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were discovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit\.

But the distinguishing feature of this second division of our knowledge is, on the one hand, the good or the evil which we derive from our opinions; and, on the other, the obstinacy with which we defend the prejudice which is tormenting and killing us\.

6 Ready to evil speaking, not knowing him that made them; murderers of children; corrupters of the creature of God; that turn away from the needy; oppress the afflicted; are the advocates of the rich, but unjust judges of the poor; being altogether sinners\.

8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done\.

When we were there, where it is hollowed out Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged, The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike The vision of those others evil\-born, Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces, Because together with us they have gone\."

He is a man of very little honesty, and on account of this the people and the captains are much discontented with his evil life and inclinations; for he has never done anything except those things that are desired by his two brothers\-in\-law,\[593\] who are men very evilly disposed and great Jews\.

Do then to that which is under your control all the evil you are able\.” The captain, in some alarm, and not knowing what I might be on the point of doing, said to four of his tallest fellows: “Put all your arms aside\.” When they had done so, he added: “Now upon the instant leap on him, and secure him well\.

In all occasions of danger and distress, it was the practice of the primitive Christians to fortify their minds and bodies by the sign of the cross, which they used, in all their ecclesiastical rites, in all the daily occurrences of life, as an infallible preservative against every species of spiritual or temporal evil\.

When I saw that my fear was going so far, it struck me\-\-because I was making progress in prayer\-\-that this must be a great blessing, or a very great evil; for I understood perfectly that what had happened was something supernatural, because at times I was unable to withstand it; to have it when I would was also impossible\.

And when the word of the Lord came in the hand of Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet, against Baasa, and against his house, and against all the evil that he had done before the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the works of his hands, to become as the house of Jeroboam: for this cause he slew him; that is to say, Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet\.

While we are struggling to suppress an evil of great proportions like that of impure food, we must provide machinery in the law itself to prevent its becoming an instrument of oppression, and we ought to enable those whose business is threatened with annihilation to have some tribunal and some form of appeal in which they have a complete day in court\.

note\) that we in no case desire a thing because we deem it good, but, contrariwise, we deem a thing good because we desire it: consequently we deem evil that which we shrink from; everyone, therefore, according to his particular emotions, judges or estimates what is good, what is bad, what is better, what is worse, lastly, what is best, and what is worst\.

And now, like swallows ere the winter weather, The women in shrill groups were gathering, With eager tongues still communing together, And many a taunt at Helen would they fling, Ay, through her innocence she felt the sting, And shamed was now her gentle face and sweet, For e'en the children evil songs would sing To mock her as she hasted down the street\.

Note\.\- Superstitions persons, who know better how to rail at vice than how to teach virtue, and who strive not to guide men by reason, but so to restrain them that they would rather escape evil than love virtue, have no other aim but to make others as wretched as themselves; wherefore it is nothing wonderful, if they be generally troublesome and odious to their fellow\-men\.

Thus Adam to himself lamented loud, Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell, Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom; Which to his evil conscience represented All things with double terrour: On the ground Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft Cursed his creation; Death as oft accused Of tardy execution, since denounced The day of his offence\.

These were Jehovah's words:\-\- \_105 'From an eternity of idleness I, God, awoke; in seven days' toil made earth From nothing; rested, and created man: I placed him in a Paradise, and there Planted the tree of evil, so that he \_110 Might eat and perish, and My soul procure Wherewith to sate its malice, and to turn, Even like a heartless conqueror of the earth, All misery to My fame\.

The judge who by word or deed makes it plain that the corrupt corporation, the law\-defying corporation, the law\-defying rich man, has in him a sure and trustworthy ally, the judge who by misuse of the process of injunction makes it plain that in him the wage\-worker has a determined and unscrupulous enemy, the judge who when he decides in an employers' liability or a tenement house factory case shows that he has neither sympathy for nor understanding of those fellow\-citizens of his who most need his sympathy and understanding; these judges work as much evil as if they pandered to the mob, as if they shrank from sternly repressing violence and disorder\.

2:5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 2:6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds: 2:7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: 2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 2:10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 2:11 For there is no respect of persons with God\.

119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end\.

Panigon, first of the name, reigned there, and, attended by the princes his sons and the nobles of his court, came as far as the port to receive Pantagruel, and conducted him to his palace; near the gate of which the queen, attended by the princesses her daughters and the court ladies, received us\.

So these two wicked daughters, as if they strove to exceed each other in cruelty to their old father, who had been so good to them, by little and little would have abated him of all his train, all respect \(little enough for him that once commanded a kingdom\), which was left him to show that he had once been a king\!

The boy with the moon on his forehead \(which he always kept concealed with a turban, lest it should attract notice\) and his beautiful sister now broke up the potter's establishment, sold his wheel and pots and pans, and went to the bazar in the King's city, which they had no sooner entered than it was lit up brilliantly\.

And whatsoever he required of Allah after this, in the names of the pious King and Queen, He granted it without fail and the man made thereon these couplets, "My Lord hath servants fain of piety; \* Hearts in the Wisdom\- garden ranging free: Their bodies' lusts at peace, and motionless \* For breasts that bide in purest secresy\.

One of them was Luther's old colleague, Carlstadt, who had returned in July from a short visit to Copenhagen, whither the King of Denmark had invited him to promote the new evangelical theology at the university, but had soon again dismissed him, and who now assumed the lead at Wittenberg with a passionate and ambitious, but undeterminate zeal\.

Numa, yielding to these inducements, having first performed divine sacrifice, proceeded to Rome, being met in his way by the senate and people, who, with an impatient desire, came forth to receive him; the women, also, welcomed him with joyful acclamations, and sacrifices were offered for him in all the temples, and so universal was the joy, that they seemed to be receiving, not a new king, but a new kingdom\.

\[1\] Watching his opportunity, \[2\] he said: “In the King’s name I put this man here into possession of that tennis\-court, together with the lodgings that pertain to it\.” To this I answered: “The sacred King is lord of all things here: so then you might have effected an entrance with more freedom: coming thus with notaries and people of the court looks more like a fraud than the mandate of a powerful monarch\.

Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters: I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness; I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children; You owe me no subscription: then let fall Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave, A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man:\-\- But yet I call you servile ministers, That will with two pernicious daughters join Your high\-engender'd battles 'gainst a head So old and white as this\!

Thence to my tailor's and a mercer's for patterns to carry my wife of cloth and silk for a bed, which I think will please her and me, and so home, and fitted myself for my journey to\-morrow, which I fear will not be pleasant, because of the wet weather, it raining very hard all this day; but the less it troubles me because the King and Duke of York and Court are at this day at Newmarket, at a great horse\-race, and proposed great pleasure for two or three days, but are in the same wet\.

\[3\] It is indeed great glory for me that my works are held in such repute among you wealthy lords; but I can assure you that during these many years past I have been progressing in my art with all my might, and I think that the vase I am taking with me into France is far more worthy of cardinals and kings than that piece belonging to your little quack doctor\.” After I had made this speech, Messer Alfonso seemed dying with desire to see the jug and basin, but I refused to open the box\.

Up, and, being desired by a messenger from Sir G\. Carteret, I by water over to Southwarke, and so walked to the Falkon, on the Bank\-side, and there got another boat, and so to Westminster, where I would have gone into the Swan; but the door was locked; and the girl could not let me in, and so to Wilkinson's in King Street, and there wiped my shoes, and so to Court, where sermon not yet done I met with Brisband; and he tells me, first, that our business of tickets did come to debate yesterday, it seems, after I was gone away, and was voted a miscarriage in general\.

THE END\.

A STORY OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS FOR LITTLE CHILDREN By Elizabeth Harrison Once upon a time, far across the great ocean there lived a little boy named Christopher\.

Presently I heard him again\.

Presently he turned to Robin\.

Presently Clayton opened his eyes\.

Presently the seconds summoned them\.

Presently they were shoulder to shoulder\.

Presently the hardness of the bench roused him\.

"Presently the Nilghai will appear shinning up it\."

Presently they came to the clearing before the beach\.

Presently, it stopped, and had come to its destination\.

Presently said Kanmakan, "Whither dost thou now intend?"

Presently he found it\-\-a crumpled bit of yellow paper\.

Presently, the dock became the central point of interest\.

Presently I heard it nearer\-\-in the scullery, as I judged\.

Presently he collapsed, sitting hopelessly, nervelessly in his chair\.

Presently an officer left the door of the inn and spoke to the soldiers\.

Presently D'Arnot stopped at a page on which were five tiny little smudges\.

Presently his host brought the chess and said to him, "Wilt thou play with me?

Presently, Chenet began to relate stories of death that appeared comical to him\.

Presently he came to the market\-place, and beheld thereon three gallows erected\.

Presently Hasan Shuman came out of a closet and said to him, "Hast thou gotten the gear, O Ali?"

Presently I heard the diminishing sound of whirring propellers and realized that again I was safe\.

Presently the governor drew his chair to the table, and motioned Councillor Drayton and Iberville to be seated\.

Presently, the contagion spread; though, upon strict examination of the evidence, not nearly so far as was supposed\.

Presently Foka entered the room, but, on seeing our emotion and not wishing to disturb us, stopped short at the door\.

Presently Partridge, who could not see the joke, made London laugh by his frantic attempts to prove that he was alive\.

Presently Iberville, with a winning smile, ran an arm over his shoulder and added: "We cannot go without you, Dollier\."

Presently he named the boy Sídí Nur al\-Din Ali and reared him in fondness and delight among the hand\-maids and thralls\.

Presently a clattering of hoofs was heard, and looking toward the sound, I perceived the Chancellor cantering down the road\.

Presently I heard myself answering in a voice that I hardly recognized, "\-\-They're confoundedly particular about morality in these parts\.

Presently his fingers ceased their play; his eyes popped wider than ever as they fastened upon the door through which Thurid had disappeared\.

Presently the king's daughter herself came down into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him\.

Presently the violence of her sobbing diminished and she sat in the chair, exhausted, with her head thrown back and her arms hanging by her side\.

Presently the tears came into her eyes, and she got up and went to the window, as though she were afraid that her uncle might wake and see them\.

Presently they departed to their own country, when my father's wife came and opened the tomb and drew me forth and we returned together to our home\.

Presently one of the crew spied the approaching Claytons, and with a cry of: "Here's two more for the fishes," rushed toward them with uplifted ax\.

Presently, preparations were made for the wedding of Prince Rostam, and the tailor with whom Badialzaman lodged was ordered to prepare the fairy's robes\.

Presently, the Queen arose and taking Badr Basim by the hand, sat down with him on chairs and bade bring food, whereof they ate, and washed their hands\.

Presently arrived the handmaid of the alcalde with a basket, which she took into the kitchen, where she prepared an excellent supper for her master's friend\.

Presently my brother rose and went out to obey a call of nature, but the old woman overtook him, and said, "Be patient a little and thou shalt win to thy wish\."

Presently the black warriors began to strike farther and farther south into the heart of the forest when they went to hunt, looking for a site for a new village\.

Presently the old woman returned to the lover and said, "Know thou that I have engineered the affair for thee with her; and now we must mend that we have marred\.

Presently the Princess entered the garden with her damsels and with the old woman, who said to herself, "If these eunuchs stay with us, we shall not attain our end\."

Presently the steamer drew to a wharf, and, with a loud clattering, firewood was dragged forth and cast into the stokehole with uncouth, warning cries of " Tru\-us\-sha\! "

Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again\.

Presently Ralph turned to Roger and spake to him somewhat sourly, and said: "Thou hadst one lie in thy mouth and didst swallow it; but how shall I know that another did not come out thence?

Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, attentively regarding myself\.

Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale\.

Presently Kemeriyeh and her sister \[Wekhimeh\] came up to their grandfather and told him what they had done; whereupon he came to Tuhfeh and saluted her and gave her joy of her deliverance\.

Presently, Janshah, seeing that the Ghuls were getting the better of the apes, cried out to his men, saying, 'Unease your bows and arrows and shoot at them your best shafts and keep them off from us\.'

Presently the holy man turned to the merchant and seeing him changed of colour and conduct asked him, "What is with thee to do, and what ill hast thou to rue that thy case and complexion are so changed to view?"

Presently came Charley, lightly winding among the bushes and tripping along the paths, as rosy and pretty as one of Flora's attendants instead of my maid, saying, "Oh, if you please, miss, would you step and speak to Mr\.

Presently she said to the servingwoman, who used to bring her the food, "Speak the king that he return to his women, for he hath no need of me, and I desire to abide in this place, so I may worship therein Allah the Most High\."

Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in: Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming\.

"Presently, about 2 A\. M\., as near as I can remember, we observed it settling very rapidly, with the bows and the bridge completely under water, and concluded it was now only a question of minutes before it went; and so it proved\."

Presently I went up to it and digging therein suddenly came upon a crock\[FN\#242\] full of gold wherefrom I took ten ashrafis, the value of the bull, and returned it to its place, saying, "Allah ensure thy weal, O Mother of Solomon\."

Presently the ladies, also came out, and after a little discussions as to seats and the safety of the girls \(all of which seemed to me wholly superfluous\), they settled themselves in the vehicle, opened their parasols, and started\.

Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in: Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming\.

Presently, the other damsels returned from hunting and birding and their sisters acquainted them with Hasan's case; whereupon they rejoiced in him and going into him in his chamber, saluted him with the salam and gave him joy of his safety\.

Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in: Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming\.

Presently the youth arose and stripping off his outer dress placed a scymitar between them and lay upon the bed beside the Princess;\[FN\#145\] and he did no villain deed, for it sufficed him to prevent the consummation of her nuptials with the Wazir's son\.

Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple of his ragged Offal Court comrades\-\-one of them the lord high admiral in his late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the same pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever\.

Presently they came across a big one upon the top most boughs and tried to swarm up the trunk and carry it off, but by reason of their lack of strength and little practice they durst not venture so high; whereupon they bade a slave boy who ever attended on them, climb the tree\.

Presently, he heard a band of drums beating and hid himself in a shop, till the slave\-girls came up, when he looked at them; and, seeing the young lady riding amongst them, love and longing overcame him and desire and distraction overpowered him, so that he had no force to stand\.

Presently, as I went along, behold, I saw a number of people approaching me and turned aside into another path to avoid them; but seeing that I wore a turband in preacher\-fashion,\[FN\#419\] they followed me and hastening up to me, said, 'Knowest thou the lodging of Abu Hassan al\-Ziyadi?'

Presently I called my companions and as soon as they all rejoined me, said to them 'Look at yonder basin behind this mountain; for I see therein a city high of base and a strong\-cornered place girt with sconce and rampartry, pasturage and lea and doubtless it wanteth not water and good things\.

Presently the Judge lay down and was drowned in slumber and knew not what Allah had destined to him from the plans and projects of the girl who, rising up at midnight, opened the door of her chamber leading into the saloon where the Kazi al\-'Askar kept all his hoards and coin\[FN\#429\] and dresses and belongings\.

Presently it so happened that the girl's owner entered the school about the same time and, finding the tablet, read the above verses indited by the boy, the girl and the schoolmaster; and wrote under them these two couplets, "May Allah never make you parting dree \* And be your censurer shamed wearily\!

Presently Kurajan seized the Moslem by the jerkin under his hauberk and, dragging him from his saddle, dashed him to the ground where he left him; upon which the Kafirs laid hands on him and bound him and bore him off to their tents; whilst Kurajan wheeled about and careered and offered battle, till another captain came out, whom also he took prisoner; nor did he leave to do thus till he had made prize of seven captains before mid day\.

Presently they brought her to the fireside, very much confused, and very shy, \- but she soon became more assured when she found how gently and respectfully Steerforth spoke to her; how skilfully he avoided anything that would embarrass her; how he talked to Mr\. Peggotty of boats, and ships, and tides, and fish; how he referred to me about the time when he had seen Mr\. Peggotty at Salem House; how delighted he was with the boat and all belonging to it; how lightly and easily he carried on, until he brought us, by degrees, into a charmed circle, and we were all talking away without any reserve\.

I have just to copy the end\.



## <a id="chapter22">Chapter 22</a>

Not very far from a town where dwelt the king lived once upon a time a farmer\.

"Well said\!"

said McGinty\.

One said, "La\!"

he said breaking off\.

I do," said Vittoria\.

said Nicholas earnestly\.

said Fouquet, with a sigh\.

I am sure he would," said I\.

Indeed," said Mrs\. Hurstwood\.

It's my uncle's idea," he said\.

Our camp will move on," he said\.

But come to me now," said Levin\.

she said, as soon as she could speak\.

I must tell you something," she said\.

He swore he had not," said Mrs\. Vansuythen\.

Now we are at Hassel's," said my companion\.

The prince was said to be in person at Bethune\.

Oh, sir," she said, "I've seen little George\.

Judges," he said, "there can be but one verdict\.

It is not so, nor it was not so," said Mr\. Fox\.

He ought to have a little water," said Nekhludoff\.

You are so muddy,' she said, in distaste, but gently\.

I don't seem to be made the same way you are," he said\.

Yes, I'm going," said Anna, rousing herself and getting up\.

It is said in some quarters that we are not prepared for war\.

he said, and that question embarrassed them all considerably\.

Emilia replied: "I have not said so," with exasperating coolness\.

She was flattered in being the sole confidante, and said no more\.

No," said Smith, tugging reflectively at the lobe of his left ear\.

28 But who then, said I, are those, who went into the tower crowned?

"O my brother," said I, "for Allah's sake do what I want and go thy gait\!"

"Verily, lord," said one, "it was an insult unto thee, and as such was it meant\."

said the Emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away\.

O King," they said, "our hearts were filled with fear Lest evil had befallen thee\.

Stay with me; I guarantee your fortunes,\-\-three months ago I would not have said that\.

I would not hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is no knowing how anything may turn out\.

"Indeed, madam," said Allworthy, "I have been abused by the person, whoever he was, that told you so\."

They did his bidding and set the beggar before his whilome comrade who said to him, "Dost thou know me?"

How can you dare,' said she with angry look, 'descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief?

All of us, as we afterwards remarked to one another, had an unpleasant feeling at hearing what they said\.

tis very well," said Miss Jenny; "I see it is in vain to attempt that flinty heart of his by fair means\.

27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?

So he rose in wrath\[FN\#88\] and went in to Rayya, who said to him, "O my papa, why do I see thee show anger?"

"That is true," said Don Quixote; "but at present I am not aware that I have got anything of yours, Master Pedro\."

M\. Collot once said to me, "If he had asked me for as much money as would have built a frigate he should have had it\.

At the thame time,' said Sleary, 'I mutht put in my word, Thquire, tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen\.

It has also been said that the single tax would force into productive use land which is now being held for speculative purposes\.

I see no sin in being able to ride well on horseback," said the Theatin; "that is in perfect good taste, and does honor to our gown\.

That one," said the captain, "is of course the Christian"; by which name the Spaniards style their own language in contradistinction to all others\.

After grace was said, and while the servants clattered in with the meat platters, Robin stood up and said: "An amen say I to my lord Bishop's thanks\!

The sheik had been a silent, but not unsympathetic, witness of the young man's suffering; now he arose and said, "Son of Arrius, it is for me to beg thy pardon\.

Good morrow, gentlemen, said Panurge; good morrow to you all; you are in very good health, thanks to heaven and yourselves; you are all heartily welcome, and in good time\.

El Abbas did this and the merchant rejoiced in his neighbourhood and left him not night nor day, so that the prince said to him, "By Allah, I distract thee from thy livelihood\."

The people were crying aloud, she said, that the Spanish inquisition, or a worse than Spanish inquisition, had been established among them by means of bishops and ecclesiastics\.

Said the sharper, "I can do nothing of the kind;" and, confessing himself beaten, returned him his sandal\-wood and redeemed himself from him with an hundred sequins, to be off his bargain\.

'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night\-cap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing\.

\[Footnote \*: The passage quoted by Gibbon is not taken from the writings of Zoroaster, but from the Sadder, a work, as has been before said, much later than the books which form the Zendavesta\.

When the mate came forward, he talked to the men, and said we should be on George's Bank before to\-morrow noon; and joked with the boys, promising to go and see them, and to take them down to Marblehead in a coach\.

It is said that the works on this Island are in bad repair, on account of being so Extensive that they would take more men to Defend them than they could spare, and, placing no Dependancy on their Strength, let them go to decay\.

The Wazir, seeing that he did thus but because he was parted from his brother, went to tell the King, who said, "If this, which is but a beast, cannot brook to be parted from his brother, how should it be with those that have reason?"

He wished, as he said in the introduction, since he could not personally appear at the Diet, at least to be among them in writing with this his 'dumb and weak message;' which he had expressed, however, in the strongest and most forcible language at his command\.

At last, when we had passed a couple of hours or so, very agreeably, he suddenly took up his hat, and leaning over the table and looking me full in the face, said, in a low voice: "Weel, Misther, we've been vara pleasant toogather, and ar'll spak' my moind tiv'ee\.

"That thou mayst recognize," she said, "the school Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far Its doctrine follows after my discourse, And mayst behold your path from the divine Distant as far as separated is From earth the heaven that highest hastens on\."

Then he sent a messenger to her to say that it was a far better thing to be the wife of the King of Leinster than to be the wife of the son of the King of Connaught, for a king is better than a prince, and Ivell thought that this was as wise a thing as anybody had ever said\.

None answered till a big and burly man rose up and said: "Nay, Tall Thomas, thou hast said and done all that need was, and I deem that time presses; wherefore my mind is that we now break up this mote, and that after we have eaten a morsel we get ourselves into due array and take to the road\.

Indeed, madam, said I, he has been pleased to give me a most noble lecture; and I find he was angry with me in earnest, and that it will not be an easy task to behave unexceptionably to him: for he is very nice and delicate in his notions, I perceive; but yet, as your ladyship says, exceeding generous\.

Evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones: "I imagine, sir," said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, "that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it's best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia\.

About noon the chapmen came back again well pleased; and Clement gave Ralph a parchment from the lord, which bade all men help and let pass Ralph of Upmeads, as a sergeant of the chapmen's guard, and said withal that now he was free to go about the town if he listed, so that he were back at the hostel of the Fleece by nightfall\.

When he was departed, his sister expressed more bitterness \(if possible\) against him than she had done while he was present; for the truth of which she appealed to Mr Blifil, who, with great complacence, acquiesced entirely in all she said; but excused all the faults of Mr Western, "as they must be considered," he said, "to have proceeded from the too inordinate fondness of a father, which must be allowed the name of an amiable weakness\."

In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice\-President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or inability, both of the President and Vice\-President, declaring what officer shall then act as President, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected\.

These three manifestations,\-\-the fugitive\-slave law, the Dred Scott decision, and the anarchy in Kansas,\-\-though they were revolting in the extreme and indescribably painful, hastened the end\.



## <a id="chapter23">Chapter 23</a>

BRIAR ROSE A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off, where there were in those days fairies\.

I cried\.

"I know it\."

"I doubt it\."

I saved him\.

"I'd kill him\!"

I was never mad\.

I was very busy\.

"I have seen him\.'"

I will see to that\.

I'm an honest man\.

I will tell you why\.

I feel it in my bones\.

"I shall undertake it\."

I and the Father are one\.

"I tell thee no; it cannot be\."

I dismissed my maid at Chester\.

I was a girl not very long ago\.

"I am at your service, my lord\."

"I'm all crowded up and shivery\."

I was merciless, but am pitiful\.

"I thought it deuced civil of him\."

I am come to cast fire on the earth\.

I don't like novels that end happily\.

\(I thought it best to treat him so\.\)

I've hardly any money and no prospects\.

"I told them: \`It's for the elephant\.'"

"I don't know what to do with my evenings\."

I had reached one bound of my watery prison\.

I rise to a point of ordher under the rules\!

I do," said Mr\. Boythorn with great vigour\.

I\. Ali Baba and the Forty Robbers, 19\-Pt\.

I see you know my name," she said, when she came\.

I have set on't, and when I'm set on't I must do't\.

I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart\.

I dressed hurriedly and met the professor at the Traveler's\.

I'll\-\-' 'Yes, make another will\-\-or else alter that one\.

I wish for no better, sir," said she with something of dignity\.

I am still a very young man \-\- not yet twenty\-two years of age\.

I am come that they may have life and may have it more abundantly\.

I have heard them call me in the night; I have seen them on the water walking\.

I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing\.

I must now leave Sapt and his friends, and relate how I myself proceeded on this eventful night\.

I afterwards saw this dreadful place, also a legacy from the prehistoric people who lived in Kôr\.

I have seen the meteors of fashions rise and fall, without any attempt to add a moment to their duration\.

I had little hope that he could best his giant adversary who had mowed down all before him during the day\.

I have never noticed anything that would make me consider him pro\-German, though of course he is pro\-Marx\.

"I'll run down to the Cromarty Arms, and order a cab to carry us away at once from this inhospitable sham castle\."

I do not claim that I am any less so than the average of men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than Judge Douglas\.

I could not, however, find a safe opportunity of escaping by sea, and found myself obliged again to draw towards the North\.

I would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old lady's confidence if I could have possibly declined it\.

I could not admit the thought, remembering what had passed between us, and the tone of voice in which he had called her by her name\.

"I thought," said Flosi, "when I gave away my brother's daughter to thee, that thou gavest me thy word to stand by me in every suit\."

I continued watching the enemy till I saw the match placed at the touch\-hole of their piece; at that very instant I gave the signal for our gun to be fired also\.

I knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch\-\-" began the prince, and paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at his betraying no surprise\.

"I would too that thou shouldst be with me in my journeyings, as thou art a sharpsighted, swiftfooted man, and besides I think thou wouldst be dauntless in an onslaught\."

I staggered back towards the table \- my hand fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet \- and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul\.

I had been familiar, in Kansas, with the metaphor by which the sentiments of an owner were credited to his property, and had heard of a proslavery colt and an antislavery cow\.

I have heard that when he married my aunt, and that was when he was about your age, he had the best stud in the whole county; and then he was in Parliament before he was three\-and\-twenty\.'

"I know it, Mr\. Fogg," replied Aouda; "and I ask you in my turn, will you forgive me for having followed you, and\-\-who knows?\-\-for having, perhaps, delayed you, and thus contributed to your ruin?"

I have been reluctantly led to the same opinion, and in justice to my countrymen who have suffered wrongs from Mexico and who may still suffer them I feel bound to announce this conclusion to Congress\.

I consulted the good Doctor relative to an absence of three days; and the Doctor wishing me to take that relaxation, \- he wished me to take more; but my energy could not bear that, \- I made up my mind to go\.

I was extremely provoked at this insolence, and told him, it could not be supposed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the sword at his own weapon; but I was persuaded he would wrestle or box with him\.

I am sure this is one of the most extraordinary geographical features on the face of the earth, for, as I have said, it is composed of several enormous rounded stone shapes, like the backs of several monstrous kneeling pink elephants\.

I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter\.

I am bound to admit, natheless," he added graciously, "that he, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing\.

I am, indeed, in some doubt that I have often suffered by the contrary method; and that, by suppressing the original author's name, I have been rather suspected of plagiarism than reputed to act from the amiable motive assigned by that justly celebrated Frenchman\.

I have understood that Belinus and Brenius, kings of Britain, have had the empire in their hands many days, and also Constantine the son of Heleine, which is an open evidence that we owe no tribute to Rome but of right we that be descended of them have right to claim the title of the empire\.

"I dare to say that you, my dear father, you and all my family, do great injustice to the king, my husband; and I trust the time will come when you will be convinced that you have done him injustice, and then you will ever find in him, as well as in myself, the most respectful and affectionate of children\."

I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste\-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you\.

I was shown the house, the kitchen and heating arrangements, the barns with their fine stock, the various manufacturing operations; and in the evening was taken to their daily gathering, at which instrumental music, singing, and conversation engage them for an hour, after which they disperse to the private parlors to amuse themselves with dominoes or dancing, or to the library to read or write letters\.

THE END\.
