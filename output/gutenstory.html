<p>THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership and set up house together.</p>

<p>I say, Tit!</p>

<p>I am happy.</p>

<p>I hate him!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be off.</p>

<p>I will not dine.</p>

<p>I know who it is.</p>

<p>I am drunk, Rodya!</p>

<p>I know,&quot; said Dick.</p>

<p>I cannot be deceived.</p>

<p>I know Charasse&#8217;s book!</p>

<p>I am going to dinner now.</p>

<p>I glanced at her sharply.</p>

<p>I wish that we may be friends.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what has happened.</p>

<p>I &#8217;ve got some ideas from you.</p>

<p>I have just returned from Egypt.</p>

<p>I had other duties,&quot; thought he.</p>

<p>I except only the King of Saxony.</p>

<p>I was speaking of you yesterday.</p>

<p>I laughed out loud in my delirium.</p>

<p>I will make trial of your housewifery.</p>

<p>I think that was the chain of events, Mr.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get you a peg and you&#8217;ll go to sleep.</p>

<p>I say then: Hath God cast away his people?</p>

<p>I&#8217;d flay him myself, but I like him too much.</p>

<p>I protested my innocence of these things.</p>

<p>I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again.</p>

<p>I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month.</p>

<p>I have seen Mary, as it was certainly my duty to do.</p>

<p>I tell thee this, lest thou say later I deceived thee.</p>

<p>I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever.</p>

<p>I instantly became sure she had just come out of the copse.</p>

<p>I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.</p>

<p>I should regain my pride if I could be resolved on a step.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m nearly starved, and I have only half a sandwich left.</p>

<p>I must drive to help poor Chums and see about the Inquest.</p>

<p>I blame not her; she could say little lesse: She had the wrong.</p>

<p>I cannot bear to see these proud Dorias thus overtop our family.</p>

<p>I hate a religion that teaches one to be so onesided to one&#8217;s charity.</p>

<p>I think Mr Winterbones had better go back to the London office,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.</p>

<p>I slid down into the soft sand beside her and asked her what was the matter.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think about him or anyone else, and I don&#8217;t want anything of the kind.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hanged if I&#8217;ll stand your airs of superiority and infernal pity and patronage.</p>

<p>I foresaw it; but this I will say, I did not credit the man with his infernal cleverness.</p>

<p>I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>I bepitied him, so I did, when he used to hug his pillow, and call it his dear Madam Sophia.</p>

<p>I will not say it shall be so, but rather I will say: here in this world he changed his life.</p>

<p>I am unable to conceive how a message can be less safe by the express than by a staff-officer.</p>

<p>I believe,&#8220; he said, &#8221;that the real will never find an irremovable basis until it rests on the ideal.</p>

<p>I mourned for him who might have won the love and admiration of thousands, as he had won mine long ago.</p>

<p>I am ready to spare him, however, even now; but solely out of respect for yourself, Varvara Ardalionovna.</p>

<p>I was only going to say--&#8217; &#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t tell me what you were going to say,&#8217; interposed Mrs. Sowerberry.</p>

<p>I rejoined, &quot;By Allah, I conjure thee to explain to me the meaning of the knife and the iron dram-weight.</p>

<p>I love the brave: but it is not enough to be a swordsman,--one must also know WHEREON to use swordsmanship!</p>

<p>I am compelled to admit she is not the saint he deems it the portion of every creature wearing petticoats to be.</p>

<p>I pray you then, in love and dear alliance, Let that one article rank with the rest; And thereupon give me your daughter.</p>

<p>I was one day sauntering on the Caesodre, when a Jew, with whom I had previously exchanged a word or two, came up and addressed me.</p>

<p>I shall whisper it here, but some day I shall stand upon the dome of the Temple of Reward and shout it to cheering multitudes below.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you, where the air is pure, where every sound soothes, where one is sure to be humbled, however proud may be his nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>I say this to you with absolute earnestness, for I perceive you to be strange to our ways--a cuckoo that has blundered into the wrong nest.</p>

<p>I rejoiced and said to her, &quot;O maiden, if thou wilt release him shine shall be whatever cattle and property of mine are under thy father&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>I was well armed with shirt and sleeves of mail, and having my sword and dagger at my side, made off along the street as quick as my two legs would carry me.</p>

<p>I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.</p>

<p>I remember how picturesque the effect was, when, at the signal, all rose again, like Roderick Dhu&#8217;s men, and the green wood appeared suddenly populous with armed life.</p>

<p>I preserved a lively remembrance of the situation which struck me at the other extremity of the lake, and of which I, some years afterwards, gave a description in my New Eloisa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never had any doubt that you would be the same, whenever I migh see you,&#8221; said Philip,--&#8220;I mean, the same in everything that made me like you better than any one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>I know that it would have interested me greatly to have read even so short and dull a sketch of the mind of my grandfather, written by himself, and what he thought and did, and how he worked.</p>

<p>I think, Edward,&#8220; said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the last morning, &#8221;you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions.</p>

<p>I go to my post, sir, by my fireside,&#8217; the captain replied; nor could he be induced to leave his post vacant by the squire&#8217;s promise to him of a sermon that would pickle his temper for a whole week&#8217;s wear and tear.</p>

<p>I was making my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>I must yet entertain the hope that it is possible to secure a calm, patriotic consideration of such constitutional or statutory changes as may be necessary to secure the choice of the officers of the Government to the people by fair apportionments and free elections.</p>

<p>I do not, nevertheless, understand how a man can extend the pleasure of drinking beyond thirst, and forge in his imagination an appetite artificial and against nature; my stomach would not proceed so far; it has enough to do to deal with what it takes in for its necessity.</p>

<p>I have often heard gentlemen, who were thoroughly loyal to the Union, speak of what a splendid fight the South had made and successfully continued for four years before yielding, with their twelve million of people against our twenty, and of the twelve four being colored slaves, non-combatants.</p>

<p>I will now try to recollect my scattered thoughts, and resume my reason; and shall find trouble enough to replace my affairs, and my own family, and to supply the chasms you have made in it: For, let me tell you, though I can forgive you, I never can my sister, nor my domestics; for my vengeance must be wreaked somewhere.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter2chapter2:wwhya"><a id="chapter2">Chapter 2: ^[^\w]*Why</a></h2>

<p>[FN#434] It fortuned once upon a time that two men went forth from the same place, one foregoing the other, and they forgathered by the way.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why should I?</p>

<p>Why had he fled?</p>

<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t he?</p>

<p>Why did you stay?</p>

<p>Why should I be?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Why, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why do you seek me?</p>

<p>Why should you want?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why have we stopped?</p>

<p>Why do they offer it?</p>

<p>Why should anyone pay?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, great heaven!</p>

<p>Why, I don&#8217;t know her.</p>

<p>Why are you distressed?</p>

<p>Why, what&#8217;s the matter?</p>

<p>Why didn&#8217;t you warn me?</p>

<p>Why are you worrying me?</p>

<p>Why are you laughing again?</p>

<p>Why can&#8217;t you act upon them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mos&#8217; sholy it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hate him, therefore?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why very well then Esc.</p>

<p>Why had he not called for help?</p>

<p>Why we left the church of Rome.</p>

<p>Why, where does he go a-begging?</p>

<p>Why did he say bluntly, &#8216;With her&#8217;?</p>

<p>Why, you&#8217;re sitting on my clothes!</p>

<p>&#8217;Why, such a regular Bluebeard!</p>

<p>Why was James driven from the throne?</p>

<p>Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?</p>

<p>Why had he ever considered it obscure?</p>

<p>Why, my child, aspire to such a height?</p>

<p>Why should there be bitter words between us?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I have related the events to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why what a mad-cap hath heauen lent vs here?</p>

<p>Why Brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?</p>

<p>Why in good thunderation can&#8217;t you be more easy?</p>

<p>Why don&#8217;t you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, really, it was all exactly as you say!&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, the scene between Ray and me when I refuse him.</p>

<p>Why hast thou absented thyself so long from my house?</p>

<p>Why doth the Iew pause, take thy forfeiture Shy.</p>

<p>Why, O Lord, cannot we burn like them with silent love?</p>

<p>Why should she have been less prone to love than he was?</p>

<p>Why don&#8217;t you keep part of your money and buy yourself one?</p>

<p>Why, what is the moment to help her but when she is so miserable?</p>

<p>Why did you take some patterns of the king&#8217;s costumes at Percerin&#8217;s?</p>

<p>Why, I have been impressing it upon her all this while for her own good.</p>

<p>Why would you be so fond to ouercome The bonnie priser of the humorous Duke?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;re all seamen aboard here, I should think,&#8221; said the lad Dick.</p>

<p>Why don&#8217;t they go up to the town and fight like--&#8220; &#8221;Come, let&#8217;s get the drum.</p>

<p>Why,&#8220; said I, &#8221;Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think.</p>

<p>--&quot;Why, General, I hope you may have reason on your part to be pleased with him.</p>

<p>Why,&#8220; said he, &#8221;grant a capital of $35,000,000 when the first company only had $11,000,000?</p>

<p>Why, Frederick,&#8217; said she, &#8217;I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.</p>

<p>Why should he be tearing about aimlessly on a motor bicycle this May morning when he ought to be in France?</p>

<p>Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the Lord among the children of Israel?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the idea of taking quarters with Senor Perez seems to me very reasonable, and for my part I agree to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, when I was at Oxford in the year &#8217;87,&#8220; he said chattily, &#8221;I fancied myself in love with the female assistant at a tobacconist shop.</p>

<p>Why, my boys have been to Cincinnati, with five hundred dollars&#8217; worth of colts, and brought me back the money, all straight, time and agin.</p>

<p>Why lo-you now; I haue spoke to th&#8217; purpose twice: The one, for euer earn&#8217;d a Royall Husband; Th&#8217; other, for some while a Friend Leo.</p>

<p>Why, I&#8217;m buying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, for the glory of it, that Ryabinin, and no one else, should have bought the copse of Oblonsky.</p>

<p>Why,&#8217; says I, &#8217;if you can get any woman you like to take your word, I suppose your wife would not dispute the liberty with you that she takes herself.</p>

<p>{Why then, take steps to make available through the Gutenberg Project an article arguing AGAINST the right of women to vote--an article written by a woman?</p>

<p>Why, you should be as salt To season others with good document, Your lives as lamps to give the people light, As shepherds, not as wolves to spoil the flock.</p>

<p>Why, brother,&#8220; said Hugh, &#8221;I think my blessing will abide the morrow&#8217;s morn, for I have nought so fair and dear to show our father and mother as thou hast.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Master Linton,&#8217; said I, &#8217;three hundred miles is a great distance; and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared with what they do to you.</p>

<p>Why, when he had heard Mrs Holt screaming &#8220;murder,&#8221; he had cowered under the bed clothes and waited, expecting to hear the blood dripping through the ceiling on to his own floor.</p>

<p>Why, it does not, and that&#8217;s the truth,&#8217; answered Miss La Creevy; &#8217;and then people are so dissatisfied and unreasonable, that, nine times out of ten, there&#8217;s no pleasure in painting them.</p>

<p>Why is it that Protestantism, after carrying everything before it in a time of comparatively little knowledge and little freedom, should make no perceptible progress in a reasoning and tolerant age; that the Luthers, the Calvins, the Knoxes, the Zwingles, should have left no successors; that during two centuries and a half fewer converts should have been brought over from the Church of Rome than at the time of the Reformation were sometimes gained in a year?</p>

<p>Of the forces of the court and its far-reaching might, of the high worship (18) and of the chivalry these lords did ply with joy throughout their life, of this forsooth none might relate to you the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter3chapter3:wweba"><a id="chapter3">Chapter 3: ^[^\w]*We\b</a></h2>

<p>yesterday, the day before yesterday; last year, ultimo; lately &amp;c. (newly) 123. retrospectively; ere now, before now, till now; hitherto, heretofore; no longer; once, once upon a time; from time immemorial, from prehistoric times; in the memory of man; time out of mind; already, yet, up to this time; ex post facto.</p>

<p>We say more odious.</p>

<p>We need your donations.</p>

<p>We will have some drinks.</p>

<p>We can none of us dictate.</p>

<p>We are starting in a moment.</p>

<p>We return to the Netherlands.</p>

<p>We will go far away from here.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t expect to get him home!</p>

<p>We looked at each other in amazement.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>We run onto the Rebs about sundown the 21st.</p>

<p>`We want to LEARN &#8217;em--learn &#8217;em, learn &#8217;em!</p>

<p>We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve the fists: we&#8217;ve the fists,&quot; was shouted.</p>

<p>We crossed Richmond Bridge about half past eight.</p>

<p>We had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too.</p>

<p>We arrived in the Downs on the 13th of April, 1702.</p>

<p>We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!</p>

<p>&#8220;We do the same, my friend,&#8221; said the academician.</p>

<p>We need not say how much we admire his public conduct.</p>

<p>We saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room.</p>

<p>We are poor Picard fishermen, thrown upon the coast by a storm.</p>

<p>We have greatly improved the conditions of our natural resources.</p>

<p>We saw a Hippa or Village upon the Cape and some few inhabitants.</p>

<p>We trod solid ground, we breathed air, The heavens were unbroken.</p>

<p>We got across with whole skins on ski, and continued our exploration.</p>

<p>We require to be refreshed with quavers and crescendos and trillets!</p>

<p>We have had an awful instance of the dangers of constitutional royalty.</p>

<p>We find by experience that a likely man fails and an unlikely one succeeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall soon know,&#8221; said Pencroft, &#8220;when we have scaled the palisade.&#8221;</p>

<p>We must face the fact of a hard war, a long war, a bloody war, a costly war.</p>

<p>We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass.</p>

<p>We try to choke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.</p>

<p>We shall buy some new peas, a box of strawberries and several pounds of sugar.</p>

<p>We should neither of us shrink from the task, awful though it be to contemplate.</p>

<p>We scarcely know at which end to begin to disentangle this knot of absurdities.</p>

<p>We cannot go any faster,&#8220; said the doctor; &#8221;we no longer command--we have to obey.</p>

<p>We had got well out on the country road, when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred.</p>

<p>We only met at meal times; and then, though we talked, all seemed more or less preoccupied.</p>

<p>We should be very hard to please, madam,&#8220; returned Albert, &#8221;did we not think him delightful.</p>

<p>We have now to follow the further developments of the same ever-living tendency for mutual aid.</p>

<p>We measure neither times to come, nor past, nor present, nor passing; and yet we do measure times.</p>

<p>We therefore hail with pleasure, though assuredly not with unmixed pleasure, the appearance of this work.</p>

<p>We encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an electronic path open for the next readers.</p>

<p>We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house.</p>

<p>We shall do all we can to cheapen the purchase,&#8220; he wrote, &#8221;but my present sentiment is that we shall buy.</p>

<p>We got to the station in good time, and being under shelter the lady stood a good while talking to Jerry.</p>

<p>We settle each wise affair–called wise, because proceeding direct from the will of Him who is absolute wisdom.</p>

<p>) We are not sufficiently acquainted with the history of these times to point out the person who was employed.</p>

<p>We got under weigh on the 10th, bound up to San Pedro, and had three days of calm and head winds, making but little progress.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>

<p>We halted a couple of days by the fine stream Sinjere, which comes from the Chiroby-roby hills, about eight miles to the north.</p>

<p>We owe to Wickliffe the earliest version of the Scriptures into English, which is among the first prose writings in the old tongue.</p>

<p>We have not,&#8220; says she, &#8221;had a morsel to eat, nor have these poor children had a rag to put on, but what his goodness hath bestowed on us.</p>

<p>We had had enough of these novelties and started to enter the dining-room when a slave, detailed to this duty, cried out, &quot;Right foot first.</p>

<p>We shall take leave to be strong upon the seas, in the future as in the past; and there will be no thought of offense or of provocation in that.</p>

<p>We photographed each other in &#8220;picturesque attitudes,&#8221; took a few stones for those who had not yet set foot on bare earth, and strapped on our ski.</p>

<p>We view with pride and satisfaction this bright picture of our country&#8217;s growth and prosperity, while only a closer scrutiny develops a somber shading.</p>

<p>We consider him as a person capable of contributing to the happiness or enjoyment of his fellow-creatures, whose sentiments, with regard to him, we naturally embrace.</p>

<p>We find also several historical repetitions and historical discrepancies, all of which make against the theory that Moses is the author of all this Pentateuchal literature.</p>

<p>We hope the President will not say it was their own fault that they went there, for even if they were to be blamed for doing so, they had already suffered a fearful punishment.</p>

<p>We will teach thee to recite the Koran, nor aught shalt thou forget, Save what God pleaseth; for he knoweth alike things manifest and hidden; And we will make easy to thee our easy ways.</p>

<p>We saw but few natives, and these, by escaping from their canoes into the mangrove thickets the moment they caught sight of us, gave unmistakeable indications that they had no very favourable opinion of white men.</p>

<p>We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the brink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body, and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin.</p>

<p>We only know that to produce the one or the other action, people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other words that it is a law.</p>

<p>We must maintain our strategic capability and continue the progress of the last 2 years with our NATO Allies, with whom we have increased our readiness, modernized our equipment, and strengthened our defense forces in Europe.</p>

<p>We must try to discover some actual and demonstrable and widely prevalent condition of the human mind, in which tales that even to remote and rudimentary civilisations appeared irrational and unnatural would seem natural and rational.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t spin tops&#8220; is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers, indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits; but it must be confessed that Servadac, being naturally idle, was very much given to &#8221;spinning tops.</p>

<p>We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: 14:16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.</p>

<p>We read that, when the Consul Mummius, after the taking of Corinth, was preparing to send to Rome some works of the greatest Grecian sculptors, he told the packers that if they broke his Venus or his Apollo, he would force them to restore the limbs which should be wanting.</p>

<p>We may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own species, for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species peculiar to Chatham Island.</p>

<p>We may instance the group of problems which have to do with the relation of art to ``beauty&#8217;&#8217; in its narrower sense, such as the function of the painful and of the ugly in art, the meaning of artistic imitation and truth to nature, of idealization, and the nature of artistic illusion; also the question of the didactic and of the moral function of art.</p>

<p>We also wanted shot; and an order of the day fixed a price to be given for all balls, according to their calibre, which might be picked up after being fired from the fortress or the two ships of the line, the &#8216;Tiger&#8217; and &#8216;Theseus&#8217;, which were stationed on each side of the harbour: These two vessels embarrassed the communication, between the camp and the trenches; but though they made much noise, they did little harm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, those others can follow other careers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course he was quite old,&quot; he said, and changed the subject.</p>

<p>Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves.</p>

<p>Of course, the first to come home had the cream of the praises.</p>

<p>Of course!--she it was I saw leading her children by the hand!</p>

<p>Of course he has,&#8217; said she; &#8217;it was written that he might see it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, then, he must be clever,&#8221; said De Guiche, simply.</p>

<p>Of course,&#8220; added Diana rather dolefully, &#8221;we will be a dreadfully pudgy couple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, but if she has a heart she cannot be happy--cannot even wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Kostya and Kitty have so much tact that we don&#8217;t feel it; but it can&#8217;t go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m likely to have made an error, for it isn&#8217;t easy to translate this stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course,&#8217; replied Lord Frederick, fixing his eyes on Miss Nickleby, &#8217;how can you a-ask me?</p>

<p>Of course my pride was up; for was I to defer to an untutored African on a point of pronunciation?</p>

<p>Of course I am not now considering what would be our duty in cases of insurrection among the slaves.</p>

<p>Of course, I had no foreknowledge of what has happened; but I knew something would, or might, happen.</p>

<p>Of course Fred felt as if the clouds had parted and a gleam had come: he moved and stood in her way.</p>

<p>Of course you do,&#8220; said Mr. Bucket conversationally, &#8221;and much to blame you would be if you didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Of course he would buy Joey a living, and make large presents yearly to his sister--was there anything else?</p>

<p>Of course you artillery men are very wise, because you can take everything along with you- vodka and snacks.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Casaubon had the facts in her mind, but she was not going to speak of anything connected with them.</p>

<p>Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#8217;m an ignorant outsider; but I should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too.</p>

<p>Of course during the years when I was most busy at serious work I could do no hunting, and even my riding was of a decorous kind.</p>

<p>Of course if Sir Anthony is offended, I&#8217;m only too sorry, and I beg you to assure him that I never intended the slightest discourtesy.</p>

<p>Of course I want to know you, my dear,&quot; cried Mrs. Struthers in a round rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig.</p>

<p>Of course, I was glad to renew the acquaintance, and proposed to Dr. Goodwin that we should walk to her house and visit this lady, which we did.</p>

<p>Of course Ilinka&#8217;s legs slipped down as, sinking exhausted to the floor and half-suffocated with tears, he stammered out: &quot;Why should you bully me so?</p>

<p>Of course we hated one another instinctively from the first moment we set eyes on one another, but we each told Ernest that we had been most favourably impressed.</p>

<p>Of course, this created a perfect furore, of rejoicing, and we all regarded the war as over, for I knew well that General Johnston had no army with which to oppose mine.</p>

<p>Of course, I have always supposed you were going to push straight on, as other men do--all who deserve the name--when they have been put in a good way of doing well.</p>

<p>Of course the /Leopoldine/ had arrived at night, and anchored in Pors-Even Bay, and he had rushed home; she arranged all this in her mind with the swiftness of lightning.</p>

<p>Of course, this could not be hidden, and Reuben was at once dismissed; his poor wife and little children had to turn out of the pretty cottage by the park gate and go where they could.</p>

<p>Of course there was no path, and after some perplexity amongst rocks and ravines, we reached the upper limit of wood, and halted by some bleached juniper-trees, which were soon converted into blazing fires.</p>

<p>Of course it was strange that he was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric, and all these people of high society didn&#8217;t think of what was said of them and didn&#8217;t stand on ceremony.</p>

<p>Of course, it should be added, the English language has vastly expanded since his time, and Johnson&#8217;s first edition contained only a tithe of the 400,000 words recorded in the latest edition of Webster (1910).</p>

<p>Of course the private secretary was detached as their escort, since this was one of his professional functions; and he passed six months, gaining an education as Italian courier, while the Civil War came to its end.</p>

<p>Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then (for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be extraordinarily rational.</p>

<p>Of course, I state this case as an illustration only, not meaning to say or intimate that the master of Dred Scott and his family, or any more than a percentage of masters generally, are inclined to exercise this particular power which they hold over their female slaves.</p>

<p>Of course it was to my interest to bring him to battle as soon as possible, when our numerical superiority was at the greatest; for he was picking up his detachments as he fell back, whereas I was compelled to make similar and stronger detachments to repair the railroads as we advanced, and to guard them.</p>

<p>Of course a great row occurred as to who was to blame, and many arrests and trials took place, but there had been such an interchanging of cap numbers and other insignia that it was next to impossible to identify the guilty, and so much crimination and acrimony grew out of the affair that it was deemed best to drop the whole matter.</p>

<p>Of course this can only be understood of sympathetic affections, or those felt as a secondary effect after their first impression; for commonly direct and personal affections immediately call into life in us the instinct of our own happiness, they take up all our thoughts, and seize hold of us too powerfully to allow any room for the feeling of pleasure that accompanies them, when the affection is freed from all personal relation.</p>

<p>What, shall King Henry be a pupil still Under the surly Gloster&#8217;s governance?</p>

<p>Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be joyful in their king.</p>

<p>You have spoken wisely,&#8220; said the King; &#8221;since she is present here, I advise, recommend, and urge her to surrender to you what is your right.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are no great convincing facts--&#8220; &#8221;Oh,&#8220; said the king, interrupting him with a savage laugh, &#8221;there is no need of great facts.</p>

<p>The king, on hearing this, perceived that it was his son who had been brought up by Idrís, recognised Bakhtyár as such, as made over to him the kingdom.</p>

<p>The vazÝr&#8217;s son learns from the clever daughter of a farmer that the laughing of the fish indicates that there is a man in the palace unknown to the king.</p>

<p>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: who strengthened against them Eglon, king of Moab: because they did evil in his sight.</p>

<p>So they took their rest that night, and this was on the Sunday, and so the king departed, and sent unto Sir Launcelot three knights with the four white shields.</p>

<p>Yet how much greater was the moderation of that king, than is that of your present governors, and that of the people then under him, than is that of you at this time!</p>

<p>The king was indifferent, he had said, whether the States preferred peace or war, but in making his treaty he knew that he had secured a profit for himself, iuflicted damage on his enemy, and done no harm to his friends.</p>

<p>The governor being gained, the two prisoners escape; once clear of the fangs of the law, they will call together the enemies of Colbert, and prove to the king that his young justice, like all other monstrosities, is not infallible.</p>

<p>Now, sir, said Accolon, I will tell you; this sword hath been in my keeping the most part of this twelvemonth; and Morgan le Fay, King Uriens&#8217; wife, sent it me yesterday by a dwarf, to this intent, that I should slay King Arthur, her brother.</p>

<p>3:9 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; 3:10 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</p>

<p>When it was the fifth day, the fifth Vizier, whose name was Jehrbaur, came in to the king and prostrating himself before him, said, &quot;O king, it behoveth thee, if thou see or hear that one look on thy house,[FN#111] that thou put out his eyes.</p>

<p>The fame of Edward the Confessor took such deep hold on the Irish mind that, three centuries after his death, his banner was unfurled and the royal leopards laid aside to facilitate the march of an English King, through the fastnesses of Leinster.</p>

<p>Alma 47:2 2 And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives.</p>

<p>Therefore he named Arpachshad as his successor, and through him rulership descended to Abraham, and so to Isaac, Jacob, and Judah, and to David and his posterity, down to the last Judean king Zedekiah, who was deprived of his sovereignty by Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty-third Night, She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that &quot;the King of the Beasts said to Janshah, &#8217;Commit to memory what is in these tablets; and whenas the beasts come, we will ask them anent that castle.</p>

<p>His noble charger bore him with the velocity of lightning across the trenches, but the squadrons that followed could not come on with the same speed, and only a few horsemen, among whom was Francis Albert, Duke of Saxe Lauenburg, were able to keep up with the king.</p>

<p>When Gryphon now, in his opprobrious gear, And arms, dishonoured by the rabble&#8217;s flout, Makes, by ill fortune, to the gate resort, He by the king is seen, and all his court; CXX And, taken for the man whose crest he wears, In dame and knight moves laughter, through the ring.</p>

<p>I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in Islington that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I was above a league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more, my King, for I could show, that whilst they say I was TAKING life, I was SAVING it.</p>

<p>General,&#8220; said the king, aloud, &#8221;I have just signed your patent, -- you are Duke of Albemarle; and my intention is that no one shall equal you in power and fortune in this kingdom, where -- the noble Montrose excepted -- no one has equaled you in loyalty, courage, and talent.</p>

<p>Mormon 3:4 4 And it came to pass that after this tenth year had passed away, making, in the whole, three hundred and sixty years from the coming of Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me, which gave unto me to know that they were preparing to come again to battle against us.</p>

<p>WHEN King Arthur heard of the coming of Guenever and the hundred knights with the Table Round, then King Arthur made great joy for her coming, and that rich present, and said openly, This fair lady is passing welcome unto me, for I have loved her long, and therefore there is nothing so lief to me.</p>

<p>He was condemned to death, and his family in deep distress threw themselves at the feet of the King of Saxony; but, the facts being so evident and of such a nature that no excuse was possible, the faithful king did not dare to grant indulgence for a crime committed even more against his ally than against himself.</p>

<p>Speaking of Sir G. Carteret, of whom I perceive he speaks but slightly, and diminishing of him in his services for the King in Jersey; that he was well rewarded, and had good lands and rents, and other profits from the King, all the time he was there; and that it was always his humour to have things done his way.</p>

<p>The West, from Rome to Britain, was called into action; the kings of Poland and Bohemia obeyed the summons of Conrad; and it is affirmed by the Greeks and Latins, that, in the passage of a strait or river, the Byzantine agents, after a tale of nine hundred thousand, desisted from the endless and formidable computation.</p>

<p>He also held a levee wherein were assembled all the defenders of the realm, and the Ministers and the Lords of the land came forward and condoled with him for the loss of his parent and wished him all good fortune and gave him joy of his kingship and dominion and prayed for his endurance in honour and his permanence in prosperity.</p>

<p>Thereupon Shahyal rose and assembling his troops, set out, in deference to his mother, desiring to content her and her friends, and in accordance with whatso had been fore-ordained from eternity without beginning; nor did they leave journeying till they came to the land of the Blue King, who met them with his army and gave them battle.</p>

<p>When it was the Eight Hundred and Seventeenth Night, She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Manar al-Sana was about to set out upon the journey, behold, a chamberlain of the King, her sire, came in to her and kissing the ground before her, said, &quot;O Princess, the Supreme King, thy father saluteth thee and biddeth thee to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the people of the city rejoiced and were glad and blessed the vizier&#8217;s daughter, marvelling for that three days had passed and that the king had not put her to death and exulting in that, [as they deemed,] he had turned [from his purpose] and would never again burden himself with blood-guiltiness against any of the maidens of the city.</p>

<p>The French cabinet, no longer swayed by the counsels of Henry the Great, and whose maxims of state were perhaps not applicable to the present condition of that kingdom, was now far less alarmed at the preponderance of Austria, than of the increase which would accrue to the strength of the Calvinists, if the Palatine house should be able to retain the throne of Bohemia.</p>

<p>But behold, we know that he lies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make himself a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his will and pleasure.</p>

<p>--And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till The end of the Six Hundred and Thirty-second Night, Then said she:--I have heard, O auspicious King, that the Captain despatched another of his men to the city and he found the place, but, as aforetime, when the troop repaired thither they saw each and every house marked with signs of red chalk.</p>

<p>Yet did two- thirds of the army, actuated by the perfervidum ingenium Scotorum, rush down and give an opportunity to Stanley to occupy the ground they had quitted, by coming over the shoulder of the hill, while the other third, under Lord Home, kept their ground, and having seen their King and about 10,000 of their countrymen cut to pieces, retired into Scotland without loss.</p>

<p>And the names are given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges, they having been established by king Mosiah.</p>

<p>The capital Auxume and the seaport Adulis were then the chief centres of the trade with the interior of Africa in gold dust, ivory, leather, aromatics, &amp;c. At Axum, the site of the ancient capital, many vestiges of its former greatness still exist; and the ruins of Adulis, which was once a seaport on the bay of Annesley, are now about 4 m. from the shore (see ETHIOPIA, The Axumite Kingdom.</p>

<p>This king is accustomed every day to drink QUARTILHO (three-quarter pint) of oil of GINGELLY[403] before daylight, and anoints himself all over with the said oil; he covers his loins with a small cloth, and takes in his arms great weights made of earthenware, and then, taking a sword, he exercises himself with it till he has sweated out all the oil, and then he wrestles with one of his wrestlers.</p>

<p>Spinola had carried off Conde in triumph; the Princess was pining in her gilt cage in Brussels, and demanding a divorce for desertion and cruel treatment; the King considered himself as having done as much as honour allowed him to effect a reconciliation, and it was obvious that, as the States&#8217; ambassador said, he could no longer retire from the war without shame, which would be the greatest danger of all.</p>

<p>His great bargaine of Hempe with us by his unknown proposition is disliked by the King, and so is quite off; of which he is glad, by this means being rid of his obligation to my Lord Bruncker, which he was tired with, and especially his mistresse, Mrs. Williams, and so will fall into another way about it, wherein he will advise only with myself, which do not displease me, and will be better for him and the King too.</p>

<p>The memory of Coeur de Lion, of the lion-hearted prince, was long dear and glorious to his English subjects; and, at the distance of sixty years, it was celebrated in proverbial sayings by the grandsons of the Turks and Saracens, against whom he had fought: his tremendous name was employed by the Syrian mothers to silence their infants; and if a horse suddenly started from the way, his rider was wont to exclaim, &quot;Dost thou think King Richard is in that bush?</p>

<p>Quoth Ja&#8217;afar, &quot;O my lord, all is well,[FN#194] save that this my comrade, who (as is not unknown to thee) is of the merchant company and hath visited all the great cities and countries of the world and hath consorted with kings and men of highest consideration, saith to me: &#8217;Verily, that which our lord the Caliph hath done this night is beyond measure extravagant, never saw I any do the like doings in any country; for he hath rent such and such dresses, each worth a thousand dinars and this is surely excessive unthriftiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why should I be amused?</p>

<p>But why did you come hither?</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should he fear?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why do you give them me?</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why do you smile, Seymour?</p>

<p>But why do you not refuse him?</p>

<p>But why did we teach you that?</p>

<p>But why should you dislike him?</p>

<p>But why must you run after them?</p>

<p>But why do I thus torment myself?</p>

<p>But why must the moon stand still?</p>

<p>&#8220;But why camest thou so late?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why speak of his coming poor?</p>

<p>&#8220;But why keep me in the dark?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why I had no notice of his ire?</p>

<p>But why do I mention justification?</p>

<p>But why all this about oak or stone?</p>

<p>But why should I make a long story?</p>

<p>But why should I tell you all this?</p>

<p>But why on earth did you break it of?</p>

<p>But why should you dislike clergymen?</p>

<p>But why will you talk of skeletons!</p>

<p>But why do I complain of the tyrants?</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should MY wish be obeyed?&#8221;</p>

<p>--But why do you fear a bit of bread?</p>

<p>But why should I meddle in the matter?</p>

<p>But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?</p>

<p>But why does not this doctor give details?</p>

<p>But why does he have this idea of a horse?</p>

<p>But why should you give me an expensive rug?</p>

<p>But why was he in consultation with my enemy?</p>

<p>But why any proclamation now upon this subject?</p>

<p>But why not always be my place, if it is my duty now?</p>

<p>But why are they so fond of me if I don&#8217;t deserve it?</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you tell this man, Troop, who you were?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why should emancipation South send the free people North?</p>

<p>But why do you wish to know this, who I am?-A miserable man.</p>

<p>But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?</p>

<p>But why, then, those arms and the regalia of a Tharkian chieftain?</p>

<p>But why did you bring her luggage if you intended to take her away?</p>

<p>But why should the gentleman want to go to Jerusalem after the dean?</p>

<p>--But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to come?</p>

<p>But why should I not live in peace, if we were to be friends to each other?</p>

<p>&#8217;But why should you try to make my cousin angry; you that ought to have so much sense?</p>

<p>But why&#8220;--he said to himself-- &#8221;should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts!</p>

<p>But why should his lady trouble herself for particulars of such people, whom it could scarcely be supposed she would meet by accident?</p>

<p>But why should this seven times heated fiery furnace of theological zeal be so desirous to shed its genial warmth over the London School Board?</p>

<p>But why the &#8220;allegory&#8221; should closely imitate the rough guesses of uncivilised peoples, Ahts, Diggers, Zunis, Cahrocs, it is less easy to explain.</p>

<p>] But why d&#8217;you s&#8217;pose I feel so--so--like I&#8217;d found something I&#8217;d missed and been looking for--&#8217;s if this was the right place for me to fit in?</p>

<p>But why of that great attribute Kronion joys in most, be mute,-- The majesty that hurls the thunder, And tears the fleeting clouds asunder?</p>

<p>But why then do ye slay all their carles that are taken; whereas ye bear away the women and make thralls of them at home, that is to say, foes in every house?</p>

<p>But why need we seek for other instances, while the present subject of philosophical probabilities offers us so obvious an one, in the opposition betwixt the judgment and imagination arising from these effects of custom?</p>

<p>But why should man seek glory, who of his own Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation, ignominy, and shame-- Who, for so many benefits received, Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false, And so of all true good himself despoiled; Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take 140 That which to God alone of right belongs?</p>

<p>I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler&#8217;s job, that&#8217;s at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end.</p>

<p>Presently, they came to the shop of a young merchant, by name Sídí Hasan who was very handsome[FN#192] and had no hair on his face.</p>

<p>Presently I saw this street and noting the goodly fashion of its ordinance and its cleanliness, I sheltered me therein against break of day.</p>

<p>Presently, feeling hot he opened the door, whereupon it seemed to him that a little white slave and an eunuch came in to him carrying a parcel.</p>

<p>Presently, up came two ill-favoured fellows and said to him, &quot;Come, O man, and speak with the Kazi; for thy wife hath complained of thee to him.</p>

<p>Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas.</p>

<p>Presently food was set before them, and they ate till they were satisfied; and sweetmeats and dried fruits were brought, and they enjoyed their dessert.</p>

<p>Presently our meal came to an end; the misshapen monster with the pointed ears cleared the remains away, and Montgomery left me alone in the room again.</p>

<p>Presently he called for trays spread with richest viands of all kinds and ate and fed her by mouthfuls, till she had enough; yet she spoke not one word.</p>

<p>Presently he took Sabbah and lodged him in a spacious dwelling and gave him a share of the loot; after which he went in to his mother and told her all that had befallen him in his last journey.</p>

<p>Presently, when it was full day he entered his audience hall and sat upon the throne of his kingship whereupon his Chamberlains and Grandees flocked to the presence and with them the Sage Duban.</p>

<p>Presently they carried their dead master to the ship side by side with his dead son and, having transported all the stuff from the dwelling to the vessel, set sail and disappeared from mine eyes.</p>

<p>Presently, his friends and acquaintances among the merchants and people of the market began to come up to him, by ones and twos, to give him joy, and said to him, laughing, &quot;God&#8217;s blessing on thee!</p>

<p>Presently up out of the little valley where Floing is located came the Germans, deploying just on the rim of the plateau a very heavy skirmish-line, supported by a line of battle at close distance.</p>

<p>Presently they became noted soothsayers; Shikk had issue but Satih none; they lived 300 (some say 600) years, and both died shortly before the birth of the Prophet concerning whom they prophesied.</p>

<p>Presently, Janshah, seeing that the Ghuls were getting the better of the apes, cried out to his men, saying, &#8217;Unease your bows and arrows and shoot at them your best shafts and keep them off from us.</p>

<p>Presently, the wind began to whistle less loudly, as though now it felt satisfied at having driven so much productive rain into the ground, and washed clean the mountain tops, and loosened the stony soil.</p>

<p>Presently he cried out again, &#8220;Ho boy, serve up the marinated stew[FN#688] with the fatted sand grouse in it;&#8221; and he said to my brother, &quot;Up and eat, O my guest, for truly thou art hungry and needest food.</p>

<p>Presently it opened and disclosed fifty horsemen, gathered together to waylay merchants on the highway, and their captain, by name Kahrdash, was a lion in daring and dash; a furious lion who layeth knights flat as carpets in battle-crash.</p>

<p>Presently after, Sparamizes told Parysatis what he said, and she told the king, who was greatly enraged at it, as having the lie given him, and being in danger to forfeit the most glorious and most pleasant circumstance of his victory.</p>

<p>Presently, about 2 A. M., as near as can be determined, those in the life-boats observed her settling very rapidly with the bows and the bridge completely under water, and concluded it was now only a question of minutes before she went.</p>

<p>Presently, the other damsels returned from hunting and birding and their sisters acquainted them with Hasan&#8217;s case; whereupon they rejoiced in him and going into him in his chamber, saluted him with the salam and gave him joy of his safety.</p>

<p>Presently, I heard the rush of the boar in the jungle, coming straight up the hill toward the spot where I was standing; and, fearing that he might top the ridge and make down the other side toward Dimboola, I gave him a halloo to head him back.</p>

<p>Presently it so befel that the young lady said to the old woman, her governante, &quot;Do thou take up this charger and carry it to the youth who gave us the draught of water with the intent that he may not claim an obligation or have aught to desire of us.</p>

<p>Presently he began to beseech him earnestly to grant the final victory to the Danes, since he had helped them so graciously before, and to fill up his last kindness to the measure of the first; promising to dedicate to him as a gift the spirits of all who fell.</p>

<p>Presently sleep came upon me and I was drowned in slumber from the excess of my toil and travail, when suddenly a dog-faced baboon came up to the daughter of my uncle--And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>Presently the friar joined us, who, observing his opportunity, pulled me by the sleeve and whispered, &quot;Have nothing to do with the curate, master, he is the greatest thief in the neighbourhood; if you want a pony, my brother has a much better, which he will dispose of cheaper.</p>

<p>Presently, Fernande, who was fond of music, asked Rosa to sing something, and she boldly struck up the &#8220;Gros Cure de Meudon,&#8221; but Madame Tellier made her stop immediately, as she thought it a very unsuitable song for such a day, and she added: &quot;Sing us something of Beranger&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Presently she commanded the damsels, one and all, to be seated, each in her rank and place, and all sat on a couch before one of the windows, and she bade them sing; whereupon one of them took up the lute and began caroling, &quot;Give thou my message twice * Bring clear reply in trice!</p>

<p>Presently Manjab the master of the house bade bring for his guests meats and viands meet for the great, of all kinds and of every colour, so they obeyed his orders, and when they had eaten their sufficiency they were served with confections perfumed with rose-water wondrous fine.</p>

<p>Presently, one of the shepherds raised his head and saw the bird flying near the ground and lighting alternately; so he followed him, and the crow ceased not flying just high enough to save himself and to throw out the dogs; and yet tempting them to follow for the purpose of tearing him to pieces.</p>

<p>Presently he said, &#8220;Alight on the hand of the Commander of the Faithful;&#8221; but it refused there to perch, and he cried to his father, &quot;It is thou that disgracest me amongst the Holy[FN#160] Ones, by the love of the world; and now I am resolved to part from thee, never to return to thee, save in the world to come.</p>

<p>Presently her mother came in to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and abode with her till evening; whilst the Lady Budur arose with the dawn, and repaired to the bath and, after washing herself pure, proceeded to the hall of audience, where she sat down on her throne and dispensed justice among the folk.</p>

<p>Presently, up came the Caliph, Zubaydah, Masrur and the old woman and entering, found Abu al- Hasan the Wag and wife both stretched out as dead; which when the Lady saw, she wept and said, &quot;They ceased not to bring ill-news of my slave-girl till she died,[FN#79] methinketh Abu al-Hasan&#8217;s death was grievous to her and that she died after him.</p>

<p>Presently the news reached the king that the young man El Abbas, who had gone forth from him, was come back with herds and rarities and slaves and a mighty host and had taken up his sojourn without the city, whilst his servant Aamir was presently come to Baghdad, so he might make ready dwelling- places for his lord, wherein he should take up his abode.</p>

<p>Presently he filled a cresses with firewood, on which he strewed henbane, and lighting it, went round about the tent with it, till the smoke entered the nostrils of the guards, and they all fell asleep drowned by the drug; when he entered the tent and finding Gharib and Sa&#8217;adan also insensible he aroused them by making them smell and sniff at a sponge full of vinegar he had with him.</p>

<p>Presently, she signed to one of the damsels to spread us a bed in such a place, which being done, she rose and took me by the hand and led me thither, and lay down and I lay with her till the morning, and as often as I pressed her to my breast I smelt the delicious fragrance of musk and other perfumes that exhaled from her and could not think otherwise but that I was in Paradise or in the vain phantasies of a dream.</p>

<p>Presently, the earth trembled under our feet and the black ogre came up to us and turning us over, felt one after other, till he found a man to his liking, whom he took and served as he had done the captain, killing and roasting and eating him: after which he lay down on the bench[FN#30] and slept all night, snarking and snoring like a beast with its throat cut, till daybreak, when he arose and went out as before.</p>

<p>Presently, as they stood by the mouth of the pit, the lion came scrambling up the sides and would have issued forth; but, as often as he showed his head, they pelted him with stones, till they beat him down and he fell; whereupon one of the hunters descended into the pit and despatched him and saw the boy wounded; after which he went to the cabinet, where he found the woman dead, and indeed the lion had eaten his fill of her.</p>

<p>whereto I answered, &quot;Yes; but she wept on hearing them and she replied with this couplet beginning, If he of patience fail, to the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter8chapter8:wsoba"><a id="chapter8">Chapter 8: ^[^\w]*So\b</a></h2>

<p>So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of madness.</p>

<p>So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did, really, exist.</p>

<p>So please you, sir,&#8220; said Ned, &#8221;they have recognised the unicorn, and they are firing at us.</p>

<p>So I rose from the table and went, where I found him not so ill as I thought that he had been ill.</p>

<p>So do I,&#8217; said Nicholas; &#8217;if they have no relish for theatrical entertainments, properly conducted.</p>

<p>So far from this being the case on this subject, an argument against the bank might be based on precedent.</p>

<p>So the sweetest of Roses may be yours, dear Van; and you have her in a gold setting, to wear on your heart.</p>

<p>So I took the money and going inside said in my mind, &#8217;It were ignoble to let them fare away empty-handed.</p>

<p>So long as the king was under age the mayor of the palace acted as chief officer of the government in his name.</p>

<p>So true were the words of Mr. Stuart Rem: &#8217;Half measures to purification are the most delusive of our artifices.</p>

<p>So that 130 mangelins = 162 carats, The KOH-I-NUR, when brought to England, weighed 186 carats (See Appendix A.</p>

<p>So she came to her with Badi&#8217;a al-Jamal and my mother suckled the child, who with her mother tarried with us in the garden two months.</p>

<p>So that, with every opportunity for being kept on the alert, there was small prospect of serious danger; and all promised an easy life, with only enough of care to make it pleasant.</p>

<p>So, on the morrow, she made her ready and donning the costliest of apparel, adorned herself with the most magnificent of ornaments and the highest of price and stained her hands with henna.</p>

<p>So Gharib bound him, and the Marids his comrades would have charged and rescued him, but Gharib fell on them with a thousand Marids and was about to smite them down, when they cried out &quot;Quarter!</p>

<p>So Winterbones, who during this interview had been at work at his little table, got up to lock the door, and Lady Scatcherd had no alternative but to pass through it before the last edict was obeyed.</p>

<p>So conspicuous, in fact, does Mycenae appear in the light as well of archaeology as of epic, that it has become common, somewhat misleading though it is, to call a whole epoch and a whole civilization &quot;Mycenaean.</p>

<p>So to the office and at noon home to dinner, and then sent for young Michell and employed him all the afternoon about weighing and shipping off of the corke, having by this means an opportunity of getting him 30 or 40s.</p>

<p>So saying, Nicholas took his companion by the arm, and saying a great deal more to the same purpose, and pointing out various things to amuse and interest him as they went along, led the way to Miss La Creevy&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>So he summoned Hetha, and forced her by threats rather than by arms to quit every region under her control except Jutland; and even Jutland he made a tributary state, so as not to allow a woman the free control of a kingdom.</p>

<p>So she improvised these couplets, &quot;This one, whom hunger plagues, and rags unfold, * Dearer than tribe and kith and kin I hold; Than crownèd head, or deputy Marwán, * Or all who boast of silver coins and gold.</p>

<p>So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch.</p>

<p>So imprisoned and tortured was this gentle little heart, when in the month of March, Anno Domini 1815, Napoleon landed at Cannes, and Louis XVIII fled, and all Europe was in alarm, and the funds fell, and old John Sedley was ruined.</p>

<p>So they fared on into Allah&#8217;s wide world and gave not over going night and day for a space of two months, at the end of which they came to a city on the sea-shore of the land of Makran,[FN#530] by name Al-Sharr, and it is the first city in Sind.</p>

<p>So the Alans, being still more provoked by this sight, laid waste the country, and drove a great multitude of the men, and a great quantity of the other prey they had gotten out of both kingdoms, along with them, and then retreated back to their own country.</p>

<p>So with the Papal benediction gladdening his heart, and a most earnest exhortation from the Holy Father to the Catholics of Ireland to follow his banner, this noblest of all the Catholic Geraldines departed from Rome, to try again the hazard of war in his own country.</p>

<p>So the kind-hearted lady said to the Count:--&quot;My good man, if thou art willing to leave thy little daughter with me, I like her looks so well that I will gladly take her; and if she grow up a good woman, I will see that she is suitably married when the right time comes.</p>

<p>So home back as I came, to London Bridge, and so home, where I find my wife in a musty humour, and tells me before Ashwell that Pembleton had been there, and she would not have him come in unless I was there, which I was ashamed of; but however, I had rather it should be so than the other way.</p>

<p>So, to the chant of, perhaps, a score of nightingales and other birds, the queen, her ladies and the three young men trooping beside or after her, paced leisurely westward by a path little frequented and overgrown with herbage and flowers, which, as they caught the sunlight, began one and all to unfold their petals.</p>

<p>So they beat drums and cymbals and, doffing the weed of mourning, they donned the gay garb of gladness and decorated the streets and markets; whilst the folk vied with one another who should be the first to give the King joy, and the King proclaimed a general pardon and opening the prisons, released those who were therein prisoned.</p>

<p>So was our Raymond, Count of Tripoli, assassinated (which word is derived from their name) in the heart of his city,--[in 1151]--during our enterprises of the Holy War: and likewise Conrad, Marquis of Monteferrat, the murderers at their execution bearing themselves with great pride and glory that they had performed so brave an exploit.</p>

<p>So I made for it, and as I drew near, it grew larger and brighter, till I was certified that it was a crevice in the rock, leading to the open country; and I said to myself, &quot;There must be some reason for this opening: either it is the mouth of a second pit, such as that by which they let me down, or else it is a natural fissure in the stonery.</p>

<p>So that although you may think it a great privation to lose the use of your land and houses, still you must see that this power is something widely different; and instead of fretting on their account, you should really regard them in the light of the gardens and other accessories that embellish a great fortune, and as, in comparison, of little moment.</p>

<p>So to my office where all the morning and at the Glass-house, and after dinner by coach with Sir W. Pen I carried my wife and her woman to Westminster, they to visit Mrs. Ferrers and Clerke, we to the Duke, where we did our usual business, and afterwards to the Tangier Committee, where among other things we all of us sealed and signed the Contract for building the Mole with my Lord Tiviott, Sir J. Lawson, and Mr. Cholmeley.</p>

<p>So he stayed his band, and had Ursula into the rearward, and bade all men look to their weapons, and then they went forward heedfully and in good order, and presently not only Ralph, but all of them could see men standing in the jaws of the pass with the wood on either side of them, and though at first they doubted if these were aught but mere strong-thieves, such as any wayfarers might come on, they had gone but a little further when Michael knew them for the riders of Cheaping Knowe.</p>

<p>So we all rose; and my care presently was to secure my gold, and plate, and papers, and could quickly have done it, but I went forth to see where it was; and the whole town was presently in the streets; and I found it in a new-built house that stood alone in Minchin-lane, over against the Cloth-workers&#8217;-hall, which burned furiously: the house not yet quite finished; and the benefit of brick was well seen, for it burnt all inward, and fell down within itself; so no fear of doing more hurt.</p>

<p>So he wrote his summons--sitting very fortless and all alone on that Sunday evening--dating his letter, however, for the following day:-- &#8217;PALACE, December 20, 186- &#8217;REVEREND SIR, &#8217;I have just heard from Mr Thumble that you have declined to accede to the advice which I thought it my duty to tender to you as the bishop who has been set over you by the Church, and that you yesterday insisted on what you believed to be your right, to administer the services of the parish church of Hogglestock.</p>

<p>He uttered strange sounds, and seemed very much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered continually, clutching in his hand, which hung midway between knee and foot, a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter9chapter9:moonlighta"><a id="chapter9">Chapter 9: moonlight</a></h2>

<p>JACK AND THE BEANSTALK There was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named Jack, and a cow named Milky-white.</p>

<p>There is moonlight.</p>

<p>A DRIVE IN SUNLIGHT AND A DRIVE IN MOONLIGHT XX.</p>

<p>Come on out and see the old Sphinx by moonlight.</p>

<p>They stared at one another in the clear moonlight.</p>

<p>Round to the front of the house at a trot, he stood in moonlight.</p>

<p>Black against the square of moonlight I saw him stagger, I saw him fall.</p>

<p>I walk in de moonlight, I walk in de starlight, To lay dis body down.</p>

<p>Princess Moonlight took the branch in her hand and looked at it carefully.</p>

<p>The stage is dark, but the lake and glaciers glisten in the moonlight.</p>

<p>(The porter opens the doors; a view of old Paris in the moonlight is seen): Ah!.</p>

<p>As they slid along, noiseless as shadows, in the moonlight, they came upon a run-way.</p>

<p>He noticed it first on a moonlight night, and thereafter it was always before his eyes.</p>

<p>One more heavy groan from Smith; but though he now lay in the full moonlight I could see no motion.</p>

<p>The moonlight shone directly upon Venn&#8217;s face as he spoke, and revealed all its lines to Eustacia.</p>

<p>This spread of naked rock and peaks and moonlight is like a world ready to be born, a world that waits.</p>

<p>For ye have power, men say, Our hearts in sleep to sway, And cage cold fancies in a moonlight snare.</p>

<p>She had been told that a certain road led to Plaquemine, and took it in a moonlight night and found her aunt.</p>

<p>Dunnoo, with his face ashy grey in the moonlight, implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once.</p>

<p>As soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I got up and ran to help her.</p>

<p>How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down.</p>

<p>He was seized by a thirst to hear the adorable girl, who stood there patiently, with her face lifted soft in moonlight.</p>

<p>I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow, but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion.</p>

<p>The single description of a moonlight night in Pope&#8217;s Iliad contains more inaccuracies than can be found in all the Excursion.</p>

<p>The shore was one of sand and shells, their wet cheeks sparkling in the moonlight; over it hung a promontory, a huge jut of black rock.</p>

<p>On leaving the table the husband and his friend began to play cards, while I went out on the porch to look at the moonlight with madame.</p>

<p>The sea was as calm as a mirror, the evening mild and moonlight; and so we remained on deck till late, watching the gambols of these animals.</p>

<p>Flanking it were two great moonstones of lesser size, whose glowing, beside the glory of the sunstone, was like the silvery sheen of moonlight.</p>

<p>It was very dark and empty in the passage, as though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight.</p>

<p>The moonlight and the reflection from the snow shone brightly through the little window, but Ulrich longed for darkness, and buried his face in the pillows.</p>

<p>You may bring him to the little back-gate; and I shall have pleasure, in the meanwhile, in looking on the bushes and evergreens by the bright frosty moonlight.</p>

<p>And if you take my advice, you will tell your kind, sensible old aunt the whole story, omitting of course all moonlight details, and consult her about this plan.</p>

<p>Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a lake, and then Lady Dedlock for the first time moves, and rises, and comes forward to a table for a glass of water.</p>

<p>The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.</p>

<p>I want you for a moment to picture the One Man and the One Woman facing each other in the Garden of Eden, or in the moonlight--wherever it was--if you like better.</p>

<p>They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along the path.</p>

<p>Finally, after studying the map carefully in the moonlight which now flooded the room, I pointed out a waterway far to the north of us which also seemed to lead to Helium.</p>

<p>The brilliant moonlight gleamed upon bared teeth, as I could see, even at that distance, even in that quick, agonized glance, and it gleamed upon the crescent-shaped knives.</p>

<p>Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight Through the sighing foliage streams; And each morning, midnight shadow, Shadow of my sorrow seems; Strive, 0 heart, forget thine idol!</p>

<p>The moonlight had broadened and brightened, the wind had driven off the clouds and itself died fitfully away, when he came round again to the artificial lake in front of the house.</p>

<p>Between moonlight and morning, riding with Temple and Captain Bulsted on either side of me, I drew rein under the red Grange windows, tired, and in love with its air of sleepy grandeur.</p>

<p>In another instant I was carried beyond the crest of the Golden Cliffs, out over the Valley Dor, where, six thousand feet below me, the Lost Sea of Korus lay shimmering in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Within from window and from lodge, the rout Look forth, and will the joust by moonlight view, Which streams from underneath a covering cloud; Albeit the furious rain beats fast and loud.</p>

<p>The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds, and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.</p>

<p>Ilmarinen thus made answer: &quot;I cannot believe thy story, Cannot trust thy tale of wonder, Till I see the blooming fir-tree, With its many emerald branches, With its Bear and golden moonlight.</p>

<p>Spake the wise, old Wainamoinen: &quot;Senseless blacksmith of the ages, Vainly dost thou swing thy hammer, Vainly rings thy mighty anvil; Silver will not gleam as sunshine, Not of gold is born the moonlight!</p>

<p>&#8220;The full moon had risen high when we left the last of the isles behind us; and late at night we emerged from the St. Lawrence, and arrived at Kingston, the tin roofs of which shone brightly in the moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>A mariner sat in the shrouds one night, The wind was piping free; Now bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale, And the phospher gleamed in the wake of the whale, As it floundered in the sea.</p>

<p>The elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides back to the boy in the moonlight, put down his trunk, swung him up to his neck, and almost before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the forest.</p>

<p>I thought about the friends he had mourned to leave, the trombone-player, the great forest full of game--belonging, as Antonia said, to the `nobles&#8217;-- from which she and her mother used to steal wood on moonlight nights.</p>

<p>In a moment more the little princess was dreaming in the midst of the loveliest dreams - of summer seas and moonlight and mossy springs and great murmuring trees, and beds of wild flowers with such odours as she had never smelled before.</p>

<p>The spell of the enchanted forest is broken when the crowd invades its solitude; the witchery of moonlight fades into the light of common day; and then comes Theseus with his dogs to drive not the foxes but the fairies out of the landscape.</p>

<p>He stretched himself on the shingle, thinking of the Manzanilla, and Annette, and the fine flavour given to tobacco by a dry still air in moonlight--thinking of his work, too, in the background, as far as mental lassitude would allow of it.</p>

<p>The holy doctor had been relating that memorable conversation on heavenly things which took place between his mother and himself on that moonlight night at the window in the inn at Ostia, immortalized by Ary Schaeffer in his beautiful picture.</p>

<p>She is lost to me already,&#8220; thought I, as my eye wandered over the dim and indistinguishable intricacies of architecture offered by the moonlight view of Osbaldistone Hall--&#8221;She is lost to me already, ere I have left the place which she inhabits!</p>

<p>By moonlight the scene was oppressively solemn: on all sides the gurgling waters kept up a peculiar sound that filled the air with sullen murmurs; the moonbeams slept upon the slimy surface of the mud, and made the dismal landscape more ghastly still.</p>

<p>Dan sluiced the pen energetically, unshipped the table, set it up to dry in the moonlight, ran the red knife-blades through a wad of oakum, and began to sharpen them on a tiny grindstone, as Harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under his direction.</p>

<p>When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, &quot;I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them.</p>

<p>When the moon, just risen, looks red above the eastern horizon, go out, and standing in the moonlight, with the big toe of your right foot on the big toe of your left, make a speaking-trumpet of your right hand and recite through it the following words: &quot;OM.</p>

<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful, Swam through all the deep-sea waters, Floating like a branch of aspen, Like a withered twig of willow; Swam six days in summer weather, Swam six nights in golden moonlight; Still before him rose the billows, And behind him sky and ocean.</p>

<p>The fog which, two hours before, had floated on the water, had gradually cleared off and massed on the banks, leaving the river absolutely clear; while it formed on either bank an uninterrupted wall six or seven metres high, which shone in the moonlight with the dazzling brilliance of snow.</p>

<p>that when Orion pales To dotlings under moonlight still art keen With cheerful fervour of a warrior&#8217;s mien Who holds in his great heart the battle-scales: Unquenched of flame though swift the flood assails, Reducing many lustrous to the lean: Be thou my star, and thou in me be seen To show what source divine is, and prevails.</p>

<p>But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress.</p>

<p>To be sure,&#8217; Scott concluded, &#8217;it is not much of a lion to show a stranger; but I wanted to see it again myself, for I assure you after I constructed it, Mamma (Mrs. Scott) and I both of us thought it so fine, we turned out to see it by moonlight, and walked backwards from it to the cottage-door in admiration of our own magnificence and its picturesque effect.</p>

<p>Thus the oak replies to Sampsa: &quot;I for thee will gladly furnish Wood to build the hero&#8217;s vessel; I am tall, and sound, and hardy, Have no flaws within my body; Three times in the months of summer, In the warmest of the seasons, Does the sun dwell in my tree-top, On my trunk the moonlight glimmers, In my branches sings the cuckoo, In my top her nestlings slumber.</p>

<p>Throughout the night, when the troops were encamped by the whale-boats, a black figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sand-bar and shouted that Khartoum the accursed one was dead,--was dead,--was dead,--that two steamers were rock- staked on the Nile outside the city, and that of all their crews there remained not one; and Khartoum was dead,--was dead,--was dead!</p>

<p>You would dance at a ball a dozen times with a girl engaged to a man--who drenched you with a tumbler at the hotel bar, and off you all marched to the sands and exchanged shots from revolvers; and both of you, they say, saw the body of a drowned sailor in the water, in the moonlight, heaving nearer and nearer, and you stretched your man just as the body was flung up by a wave between you.</p>

<p>TOINE MADAME HUSSON&#8217;S ROSIER THE ADOPTED SON A COWARD OLD MONGILET MOONLIGHT THE FIRST SNOWFALL SUNDAYS OF A BOURGEOIS A RECOLLECTION OUR LETTERS THE LOVE OF LONG AGO FRIEND JOSEPH THE EFFEMINATES OLD AMABLE TOINE He was known for thirty miles round was father Toine--fat Toine, Toine- my-extra, Antoine Macheble, nicknamed Burnt-Brandy--the innkeeper of Tournevent.</p>

<p>Build a metal wall around us, From the valleys to the heavens; Build of stone a mighty fortress On the borders of Wainola, Where thy people live and labor, As their dwelling-place forever, Sure protection to thy people, Where the wicked may not enter, Nor the thieves break through and pilfer, Never while the moonlight glistens, And the Sun brings golden blessings To the plains of Kalevala.</p>

<p>went on to say, that from his window he had afterwards, and late at night, seen my aunt give this person money outside the garden rails in the moonlight, who then slunk away - into the ground again, as he thought probable - and was seen no more: while my aunt came hurriedly and secretly back into the house, and had, even that morning, been quite different from her usual self; which preyed on Mr. Dick&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>No verdure more exquisite than earth&#8217;s glazing of greenery, the blend of ethereal azure and yellow; no gold more sheeny than the foregrounds of sand shimmering in the slant of the sun; no blue more profound and transparent than the middle distances; no neutral tints more subtle, pure, delicate and sight-soothing than the French grey which robes the clear-cut horizon; no variety of landscape more pronounced than the alternations of glowing sunlight and snowy moonlight and twinkling starlight, all streaming through diaphanous air.</p>

<p>And perhaps some evening next spring, moved by a beam of moonlight falling through the branches on the grass at their feet, they will join and press their hands in memory of all this cruel and suppressed suffering; and, perhaps, also this short embrace may infuse in their veins a little of this thrill which they would not have known without it, and will give to those two dead souls, brought to life in a second, the rapid and divine sensation of this intoxication, of this madness which gives to lovers more happiness in an instant than other men can gather during a whole lifetime!</p>

<p>At night the passion came, Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream, _225 And shook him from his rest, and led him forth Into the darkness.--As an eagle, grasped In folds of the green serpent, feels her breast Burn with the poison, and precipitates Through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud, _230 Frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight O&#8217;er the wide aery wilderness: thus driven By the bright shadow of that lovely dream, Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night, Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells, _235 Startling with careless step the moonlight snake, He fled.</p>

<p>And the moonlight came into Maisie&#8217;s soul, so that she, usually reserved, chattered of herself and of the things she took interest in,--of Kami, wisest of teachers, and of the girls in the studio,--of the Poles, who will kill themselves with overwork if they are not checked; of the French, who talk at great length of much more than they will ever accomplish; of the slovenly English, who toil hopelessly and cannot understand that inclination does not imply power; of the Americans, whose rasping voices in the hush of a hot afternoon strain tense-drawn nerves to breaking-point, and whose suppers lead to indigestion; of tempestuous Russians, neither to hold nor to bind, who tell the girls ghost-stories till the girls shriek; of stolid Germans, who come to learn one thing, and, having mastered that much, stolidly go away and copy pictures for evermore.</p>

<p>That that morning she had three as fair, tall sons beside her as one could find in all Nottinghamshire, but that they were now taken from her, and were like to be hanged straightway; that, want having come upon them, her eldest boy had gone out, the night before, into the forest, and had slain a hind in the moonlight; that the King&#8217;s rangers had followed the blood upon the grass until they had come to her cottage, and had there found the deer&#8217;s meat in the cupboard; that, as neither of the younger sons would betray their brother, the foresters had taken all three away, in spite of the oldest saying that he alone had slain the deer; that, as they went, she had heard the rangers talking among themselves, saying that the Sheriff had sworn that he would put a check upon the great slaughter of deer that had been going on of late by hanging the very first rogue caught thereat upon the nearest tree, and that they would take the three youths to the King&#8217;s Head Inn, near Nottingham Town, where the Sheriff was abiding that day, there to await the return of a certain fellow he had sent into Sherwood to seek for Robin Hood.</p>

<p>And my father and I admitted to all the lands; he for life, and I for myself and my heirs in reversion, and then did surrender according to bargain to Prior, Greene, and Shepheard the three cottages with their appurtenances that they have bought of us, and that being done and taken leave of the steward, I did with most compleat joy of mind go from the Court with my father home, and in a quarter of an hour did get on horseback, with my brother Tom, Cooke, and Will, all mounted, and without eating or drinking, take leave of father, mother, Pall, to whom I did give 10s., but have shown no kindness since I come, for I find her so very ill-natured that I cannot love her, and she so cruel a hypocrite that she can cry when she pleases, and John and I away, calling in at Hinchingbroke, and taking leave in three words of my Lady, and the young ladies; and so by moonlight most bravely all the way to Cambridge, with great pleasure, whither we come at about nine o&#8217;clock, and took up at the Bear, but the house being full of guests we had very ill lodging, which troubled me, but had a supper, and my mind at good ease, and so to bed.</p>

<p>I know that you will always be with me to the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter10chapter10:princessa"><a id="chapter10">Chapter 10: princess</a></h2>

<p>So Dicky won certain rises of salary--ample for a boy--not enough for a wife and child-- certainly too little for the seven-hundred-rupee passage that he and Mrs. Hatt had discussed so lightly once upon a time.</p>

<p>PRINCESS.</p>

<p>PRINCESS.</p>

<p>&#8217;Yes, princess.</p>

<p>PRINCESS (surprised).</p>

<p>The princess will be very sorry.</p>

<p>But I promised,&#8217; said the princess.</p>

<p>Oh, pardon, princess, let her go with us.</p>

<p>Princess: Coward!</p>

<p>Could it possibly be that he had talked of the princess?</p>

<p>It flashed upon him that this must be the princess&#8217;s thread.</p>

<p>&#8217;With more health than I am in need of, dearest princess.</p>

<p>The PRINCESS in a simple, but elegant dress, playing on the lute.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, princess, I&#8217;m no longer a member of the council,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The princess...the prince...the young princess...&quot; said Levin.</p>

<p>She had, however, time to warn the princess, who was walking towards Raoul.</p>

<p>At last appeared the Princess Nighara, surrounded by a score of waiting-women.</p>

<p>You will see when you get out,&#8217; answered the princess, and went on harder than ever.</p>

<p>We have been told,&#8220; Princess Mary interrupted her, &#8221;that you lost two millions in Moscow.</p>

<p>At best a princess of swamps, and swine that fight for acorns, and men that fight for swine!</p>

<p>Darya Alexandrovna disliked taking leave of Princess Varvara and the gentlemen of the party.</p>

<p>But Princess Myakaya did not agree, and the Princess Tverskaya&#8217;s opinion annoyed her indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s an eating-house and there&#8217;s a billiard-room and you&#8217;ll find princesses there too.&#8221;</p>

<p>If it throws all Helium into a bloody conflict, I shall go on with these plans to save my Princess.</p>

<p>The Princess is lovely to look at,&#8220; continued Dorothy, thoughtfully; &#8221;but I don&#8217;t care much for her, after all.</p>

<p>Another ring, set with turquois, he sent to his mother-in-law, the Princess Espinoy, from whom he had received it.</p>

<p>So they came down upon her till she swooned away; and, when she came to herself, the Princess said to her, &quot;By the Lord!</p>

<p>CHAPTER V AT THE PIANO, CHIEFLY WITHOUT MUSIC Barely had the door shut behind them when Patrick let his heart out: &#8217;The princess?</p>

<p>She returned to Darmstadt in the autumn, and on the 8th of November 1878 her daughter, Princess Victoria, was attacked by diphtheria.</p>

<p>But though he liked and respected the princess, Levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother.</p>

<p>Before she left, the Countess had come to see the little invalid, who had touched her heart so much that special evening at the Princess&#8217;s.</p>

<p>So he put it to his mouth and she rose to him and made him drink; whereupon, &#8220;O princess of the fair,&#8221; said he, &quot;this is none other than good.</p>

<p>In her profound indignation the princess hastened to General Andreossy, his Majesty&#8217;s Governor of Vienna, showed him this letter, and demanded vengeance.</p>

<p>Take that life, beseech you Which I so often owe: but your Ring first, And heere the Bracelet of the truest Princesse That euer swore the Faith Post.</p>

<p>During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a long time past.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that protege of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskaya, that Anna Mikhaylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the infamous, vile woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>She swore very vehemently, as usual, and protested that she had better never have been born than prove so miserable a princess as these tales would make her.</p>

<p>His daughter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face.</p>

<p>Then the princess played and stopped again, and this time the sea-maiden put him all out of the loch, and he called on the falcon and became one and flew on shore.</p>

<p>They asked who the bridegroom was to be, and the old lady answered, &#8220;The Prince of Hyrcania,&#8221; but added, &quot;Our princess hates him, and would rather wed a dragon than him.</p>

<p>Quoth Baba Mustapha, &#8217;&#8217;Tis ordered, O my princess and fair mistress, from the confectioner&#8217;s; and with it the sleepy drug from the seller of medicaments--accursed flea!</p>

<p>Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside Natasha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her brother&#8217;s and Natasha&#8217;s love.</p>

<p>She looked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women, and suddenly began to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it&#8217;s true,&#8221; replied the Princesse des Laumes, &#8220;for you must have asked him a hundred times, and he&#8217;s never been to your house once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the old woman came in to them, having made a pretext to dismiss the Princess&#8217;s slave girls for fear of disgrace; and the Lady Dunya said to her, &quot;Be thou our door keeper!</p>

<p>He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty.</p>

<p>I will relate an anecdote of which I can guarantee the authenticity, and which, perhaps, may foster the weakness of persons subject to the same superstitions as the Princess of Wurtemberg.</p>

<p>Thereupon, in the stress of her joy, the Princess arose hurriedly and walked towards the youth--And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>The young princess clapped her hands; and then, ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy, she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses, as if to inhale their odor.</p>

<p>On the morrow he learned, to his amazement, that he was a widower, and entertained no doubt that he had been specially directed towards the princess seen in his slumbers, whom he had never seen in life.</p>

<p>So Armanus rejoiced hereat and, summoning Kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state, bade draw up the contract of marriage between Kamar al-Zaman and his daughter, the Princess Hayat al-Nufus.</p>

<p>When he arose, the Princesses came in to him and gave him good-morrow and made merry with him as was their wont; but he paid no heed to them; so they asked his wife concerning his case and she said, &quot;I ken not.</p>

<p>In a coach of a friend&#8217;s of Dr. Cade we went to see a house of the Princess Dowager&#8217;s in a park about half-a-mile or a mile from the Hague, where there is one, the most beautiful room for pictures in the whole world.</p>

<p>The princess was soon out of breath with running uphill; but she ran on, for she fancied the horrible creature just behind her, forgetting that, had it been after her such long legs as those must have overtaken her long ago.</p>

<p>But as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he again glanced at Natasha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul.</p>

<p>Natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom, by her father&#8217;s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess who- she thought- was making a favor of receiving her, and so everything displeased her.</p>

<p>Four of these, the Elector of Brandenburg, the Count Palatine of Neuburg, the Count Palatine of Deux Ponts, and the Margrave of Burgau, an Austrian prince, claimed it as a female fief in name of four princesses, sisters of the late duke.</p>

<p>de Cambremer,&#8220; replied the Princess carelessly, and then, with more animation: &#8221;I am only repeating what I heard just now, myself; I haven&#8217;t the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of Mme.</p>

<p>For himself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his father&#8217;s affairs in order, and would even- he felt it- ensure Princess Mary&#8217;s happiness.</p>

<p>King Bud of Noland and his dainty fair-haired sister, the Princess Fluff, were friends of Zixi, as their kingdoms were adjoining, so they had traveled together from their far-off domains to do honor to Ozma of Oz on the occasion of her birthday.</p>

<p>-- The farmer&#8217;s beautiful daughter -- The king&#8217;s escapade -- The city threatened -- A Hindu princess wedded to a Muhammadan prince -- Firuz Shah&#8217;s anger -- Pertal&#8217;s marriage -- King Vijaya -- Probable date of accession of Deva Raya II.</p>

<p>Now, when Gharib returned to his camp, the Princess Fakhr Taj met him, weeping and affrighted for the terror of that which had befallen, and kissed his foot in the stirrup, saying, &quot;May thy hands never wither nor thy foes be blither, O champion of the age!</p>

<p>[FN#127] (Quoth the reciter) when the Princess raised from her face the veil and Alaeddin saw her favour he said, &quot;In very truth her fashion magnifieth her Almighty Fashioner and glory be to Him who created her and adorned her with this beauty and loveliness.</p>

<p>^127 Incensed by her resistance, Goisvintha seized the Catholic princess by her long hair, inhumanly dashed her against the ground, kicked her till she was covered with blood, and at last gave orders that she should be stripped, and thrown into a basin, or fish-pond.</p>

<p>Thus saying, she went away and forthwith returned with the Princess Shamsah, who saluted Janshah and kissed his hands, hanging her head in shame and confusion before him and her parents, after which as many of her sisters as were in the palace came up to him and greeted him in like manner.</p>

<p>M. Damesin, a gentleman of Savoy, at that time equerry, and I believe favorite, of the Princess of Carignan; M. de Boze, Secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions, and keeper of the medals of the king&#8217;s cabinet; and Father Castel, a Jesuit, author of the &#8216;Clavecin oculaire&#8217;.--[ocular harpsichord.</p>

<p>Then she took leave of the princess and veiling her face, disguised herself; [FN#30] after which she mounted the mule and sallying forth, went round about seeking her lord in the thoroughfares of Baghdad three days&#8217; space, but lit on no tidings of him; and on the fourth day, she rode forth without the city.</p>

<p>But it was after noon now, and the royal guests must prepare their toilets for the grand banquet at which they were to assemble that evening to meet the reigning Princess of this Fairyland; so Queen Zixi was shown to her room by a troop of maidens led by Jellia Jamb, and Bud and Fluff presently withdrew to their own apartments.</p>

<p>Then quoth he to himself, &quot;In very sooth Princess Miriam hath belittled us; and if I venture myself and go out against her alone, haply she will gar me succumb and slay me without ruth, even as she slew her brothers and make of me the foulest of examples, for she hath no longer any desire for us nor have we of her return any hope.</p>

<p>The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said: &#8217;Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here!</p>

<p>The man did his bidding, and when the youth came the uncle gave him the letter and bespake him as follows: &quot;O son of my brother, take thou this paper and fare with it to the Castle of Al-Hayfa and swim the stream, and go up to the building and enter therein and commit this missive unto a youth whom thou shalt see sitting beside the Princess.</p>

<p>However, the youngest was of passing comeliness in form and feature and forthwith the Shah became desperately enamoured of her; and of his live began reassuring them and saying, &quot;O ye Princesses of fair ones, be not afraid nor troubled in thought; nor let bashfulness or shyness prevent you telling the Shah what three wishes you wished, for fain would he fulfil them all.</p>

<p>No man could better make the princess herself than he could, though - leaning with her back bowed into the back of the chair, her head hanging down, and her hands in her lap, very miserable as she would say herself, not even knowing what she would like, except it were to go out and get thoroughly wet, and catch a particularly nice cold, and have to go to bed and take gruel.</p>

<p>But the Princess and her attendants ceased not wandering about the garden from site to site and side to side till they reached the place wherein the Sultan Habib lay in lurking; when Durrat al-Ghawwas there stood still and said in herself, &quot;Now I came not from my capital save on his account, and I would see and be seen by him even as the Voice informed me of him, O ye handmaidens; and peradventure hath the same informed him of me.</p>

<p>And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with which the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents.</p>

<p>Upon the quarter-deck of the flagship, sheltered by a canopy of velvet and ermine, which was suspended by stout supports, Henrietta, the queen dowager, and the young princess -- with the admiral, the Duke of Norfolk -- standing beside them -- watched with alarm this slender bark, at one moment tossed to the heavens, and the next buried beneath the waves, and against whose dark sail the noble figures of the two French gentlemen stood forth in relief like two luminous apparitions.</p>

<p>It took a long time, but I succeeded in the end.</p>

<p>If all history is not a mockery and a fable, she may be sure that the nation which deliberately carves itself in pieces and, substitutes artificial boundaries for the natural and historic ones, condemns itself either to extinction or to the lower life of political insignificance and petty warfare, with the certain loss of liberty and national independence at last.</p>

<p>If it happens that in both cases the answer is mere nonsense, we have in this an irresistible summons to institute a critical investigation of the question, for the purpose of discovering whether it is based on a groundless presupposition and relates to an idea, the falsity of which would be more easily exposed in its application and consequences than in the mere representation of its content.</p>

<p>If you could see them arriving, the old men in rags coming to die; persons who have been dying of misery for months, picking up their food at the edges of the curbstone like dogs in the street; women in rags, emaciated, sick, paralyzed, incapable of making a living, who say to us after they have told us their story: &#8217;You see that things cannot go on like that, as I cannot work any longer or earn anything.</p>

<p>If, however, the females varied and transmitted their newly acquired characters to their offspring of both sexes, the characters which were advantageous to the males would be preserved by them through sexual selection, and the two sexes would in consequence be modified in the same manner, although such characters were of no use to the females: but I shall hereafter have to recur to these more intricate contingencies.</p>

<p>Others are probably sold besides criminals, as on the accusation of witchcraft.</p>

<p>I call together the great medicine-men, the men of witchcraft, the men of magic.</p>

<p>And Jack belongs to me, for I made him even if the old witch did bring him to life.</p>

<p>For no witch-craft could change the course of the sun, and it was therefore a safe guide.</p>

<p>The Woggle-Bug and Jack Pumpkinhead were next, and behind them Glinda the Sorceress and the Good Witch of the North.</p>

<p>Ghosts, witches, dreams, visions, and portents, fill with their grisly catalogue a disproportionate space of the poem.</p>

<p>When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be thrown into the melting pot, and it seemed to Ursula they were all witches, helping the pot to bubble.</p>

<p>] FEATURES OF EUROPEAN WITCHCRAFT Witches and wizards were supposed to have sold themselves to the Devil, receiving in return the power to work magic.</p>

<p>The brother of Egil was Aunund of Witchwood, father of Hall the Strong, who was at the slaying of Holt-Thorir with the sons of Kettle the Smooth- tongued.</p>

<p>It is by witchcraft that Gretter is first lamed and finally slain; one can see that Glam&#8217;s curse, the Beowulf motif, was not really in the original Gretter story.</p>

<p>I &#8217;ll have a bout with thee; Devil or devil&#8217;s dam, I &#8217;ll conjure thee: Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch, And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.</p>

<p>There was witchcraft in little Pearl&#8217;s eyes; and her face, as she glanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish.</p>

<p>--See these, and many other particulars, in the Discourse concerning Devils and Spirits, annexed to REGINALD SCOTT&#8217;S Discovery of Witchcraft, edition 1665.&#8217;--SCOTT.</p>

<p>Ile haue a bowt with thee: Deuill, or Deuils Dam, Ile coniure thee: Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a Witch, And straightway giue thy Soule to him thou seru&#8217;st Puzel.</p>

<p>Again and again we are told that the fires are intended to burn or repel the witches; and the intention is sometimes graphically expressed by burning an effigy of a witch in the fire.</p>

<p>Now behold the fourth rede: If ill witch thee bideth, Woe-begatting by the way, Good going further Rather than guesting, Though thick night be on thee.</p>

<p>Gradually, we may suppose, the idea took form in his mind that if he could not be a witch himself, he might gain the notoriety he craved by becoming the denouncer of witchcraft in others.</p>

<p>Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz--the one who lives in the West.</p>

<p>THE SALT WITCH A pillar of snowy salt once stood on the Nebraska plain, about forty miles above the point where the Saline flows into the Platte, and white men used to hear of it as the Salt Witch.</p>

<p>In some places, while the young men are cracking their whips, the herdsmen wind their horns, and the long-drawn notes, heard far off in the silence of night, are very effectual for banning the witches.</p>

<p>Then, going from the hall of justice to the courtyard, the Dwarf said to the Wazir whose life the Prince had saved, &quot;Harkye, there is a Witch who beareth enmity against my brother, the husband of my sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now I see how it is you know Shakespeare and everything, and have learned so much since you left school; which always seemed to me witchcraft before,--part of your general uncanniness,&#8221; said Lucy.</p>

<p>Scotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags; and the &#8220;Thou shalt be King&#8221; could be quite as mournfully hurled at Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of Armuyr.</p>

<p>Now the old woman was a witch, and said to the young lady, &#8217;There is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us than for him.</p>

<p>A witch to be strong must anoint--anoint-- Then every trough will be boat enough; _205 With a rag for a sail we can sweep through the sky, Who flies not to-night, when means he to fly?</p>

<p>The good people could not conceive how it was possible to spend a night ALONE in a church surrounded by a churchyard; they perhaps considered me an evil spirit or a witch, and would too gladly have ascertained how such a creature slept.</p>

<p>The noted inquisitor Sprenger contented himself with shaving the head of the suspected witch or wizard; but his more thoroughgoing colleague Cumanus shaved the whole bodies of forty-seven women before committing them all to the flames.</p>

<p>His principal work is the &#8220;Magnalia Christi Americana,&#8221; an ecclesiastical history of New England, from 1620 to 1698, including the civil history of the times, several biographies, and an account of the Indian wars, and of New England witchcraft.</p>

<p>Food was growing scarce with them, too, as there was but little game to be found either in the Witchita Mountains or on the edge of the Staked Plains, and the march of Carr&#8217;s column from Antelope Hills precluded their returning to where the buffalo ranged.</p>

<p>He was even suspected of being accessary to his mother&#8217;s death, by forbidding sustenance to be given her when she was unwell; a German witch [714], whom he held to be oracular, having told him, &quot;That he would long reign in security if he survived his mother.</p>

<p>George Walton, a neighbor, wanted her land, for its situation pleased him, and as the old woman had neither money nor influential friends he charged her with witchcraft, and, whether by legal chicanery or mere force is not recorded, he got his hands upon her property.</p>

<p>Giue me your pardon, I haue spoke this to know if your Affiance Were deeply rooted, and shall make your Lord, That which he is, new o&#8217;re: And he is one The truest manner&#8217;d: such a holy Witch, That he enchants Societies into him: Halfe all men hearts are his Imo.</p>

<p>Both Swedes and Quakers composed the jury; there were no hysterics; the matter was dispassionately canvassed; impressions and prejudices were not accepted as evidence; and in the end the verdict was that though she was guilty of being called a witch, a witch she nevertheless was not.</p>

<p>For this youth was of all men, not even saving his uncle, most full of malice; and he hated Agatha, and would have had her suffer the uttermost of torments and he to be standing by the while; howbeit his malice overshot itself, since his tale made her even more of a witch than the lord deemed before.</p>

<p>Fitz-Eustace, loitering with his bow, To practise on the gull and crow, Saw her, at distance, gliding slow, And did by Mary swear,-- 95 Some love-lorn Fay she might have been, Or, in Romance, some spell-bound Queen; For ne&#8217;er, in work-day world, was seen A form so witching fair.</p>

<p>The Countrey Cocks doe crow, the Clocks doe towle: And the third howre of drowsie Morning nam&#8217;d, Prowd of their Numbers, and secure in Soule, The confident and ouer-lustie French, Doe the low-rated English play at Dice; And chide the creeple-tardy-gated Night, Who like a foule and ougly Witch doth limpe So tediously away.</p>

<p>She thrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously upward Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady had heard Mr. Dimmesdale&#8217;s outcry, and interpreted it, with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations, as the clamour of the fiends and night-hags, with whom she was well known to make excursions in the forest.</p>

<p>They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked out his singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there.</p>

<p>Or, when the weary moon was in the wane, Or in the noon of interlunar night, The lady-witch in visions could not chain Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light _420 Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite; She to the Austral waters took her way, Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,-- 48.</p>

<p>On the other hand it has been maintained that the ceremonial fires have no necessary reference to the sun but are simply purificatory in intention, being designed to burn up and destroy all harmful influences, whether these are conceived in a personal form as witches, demons, and monsters, or in an impersonal form as a sort of pervading taint or corruption of the air.</p>

<p>A few escapes were made, like that of a blue-eyed maid of Wenham, whose lover aided her to break the wooden jail and carried her safely beyond the Merrimac, finding a home for her among the Quakers; and that of Miss Wheeler, of Salem, who had fallen under suspicion, and whose brothers hurried her into a boat, rowed around Cape Ann, and safely bestowed her in &#8220;the witch house&#8221; at Pigeon Cove.</p>

<p>Oracle.-- N. oracle; prophet, prophesier, seer, soothsayer, augur, fortune teller, crystal gazer[obs3], witch, geomancer[obs3], aruspex[obs3]; aruspice[obs3], haruspice[obs3]; haruspex; astrologer, star gazer[obs3]; Sibyl; Python, Pythoness[obs3]; Pythia; Pythian oracle, Delphian oracle; Monitor, Sphinx, Tiresias, Cassandra[obs3], Sibylline leaves; Zadkiel, Old Moore; sorcerer &amp;c. 994; interpreter &amp;c. 524.</p>

<p>The primitive African faith seems to be that there is one Almighty Maker of heaven and earth; that he has given the various plants of earth to man to be employed as mediators between him and the spirit world, where all who have ever been born and died continue to live; that sin consists in offences against their fellow-men, either here or among the departed, and that death is often a punishment of guilt, such as witchcraft.</p>

<p>Though you and all the kings of Christendom Are led so grossly by this meddling priest, Dreading the curse that money may buy out; And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust, Purchase corrupted pardon of a man, Who in that sale sells pardon from himself; Though you and all the rest, so grossly led, This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish; Yet I, alone, alone do me oppose Against the pope, and count his friends my foes.</p>

<p>Here the cauldron sank into the ground, and a noise of music was heard, and eight shadows, like kings, passed by Macbeth, and Banquo last, who bore a glass which showed the figures of many more, and Banquo all bloody smiled upon Macbeth, and pointed to them; by which Macbeth knew that these were the posterity of Banquo, who should reign after him in Scotland; and the witches, with a sound of soft music, and with dancing, making a show of duty and welcome to Macbeth, vanished.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the ground where the tent had been pitched, being Just before the city gates, was hard and smooth; and while the Ant still crawled about, Glinda discovered it and ran quickly forward to effect its capture But, Just as her hand was descending, the Witch, now fairly frantic with fear, made her last transformation, and in the form of a huge Griffin sprang through the wall of the tent -- tearing the silk asunder in her rush -- and in a moment had darted away with the speed of a whirlwind.</p>

<p>So home and late at the office, and then home, and there found Mr. Batelier and his sister Mary, and we sat chatting a great while, talking of witches and spirits, and he told me of his own knowledge, being with some others at Bourdeaux, making a bargain with another man at a taverne for some clarets, they did hire a fellow to thunder (which he had the art of doing upon a deale board) and to rain and hail, that is, make the noise of, so as did give them a pretence of undervaluing their merchants&#8217; wines, by saying this thunder would spoil and turne them.</p>

<p>reason, ground, call, principle; by end, by purpose; mainspring, primum mobile[Lat], keystone; the why and the wherefore; pro and con, reason why; secret motive, arriere pensee[Fr]; intention &amp;c. 620. inducement, consideration; attraction; loadstone; magnet, magnetism, magnetic force; allectation|, allective|; temptation, enticement, agacerie[obs3], allurement, witchery; bewitchment, bewitchery; charm; spell &amp;c. 993; fascination, blandishment, cajolery; seduction, seducement; honeyed words, voice of the tempter, song of the Sirens forbidden fruit, golden apple.</p>

<p>It was the foreign France, the unruly, feared; Little for all her witcheries endeared; Theatrical of arrogance, a sprite With gaseous vapours overblown, In her conceit of power ensphered, Foredoomed to violate and atone; Her the grim conqueror&#8217;s iron might Avengeing clutched, distrusting rent; Not that sharp intellect with fire endowed To cleave our webs, run lightnings through our cloud; Not virtual France, the France benevolent, The chivalrous, the many-stringed, sublime At intervals, and oft in sweetest chime; Though perilously instrument, A breast for any having godlike gleam.</p>

<p>Therefore I must say that, as I hope for mercy, I can have no other notion of all the other governments that I see or know, than that they are a conspiracy of the rich, who, on pretence of managing the public, only pursue their private ends, and devise all the ways and arts they can find out; first, that they may, without danger, preserve all that they have so ill-acquired, and then, that they may engage the poor to toil and labour for them at as low rates as possible, and oppress them as much as they please; and if they can but prevail to get these contrivances established by the show of public authority, which is considered as the representative of the whole people, then they are accounted laws; yet these wicked men, after they have, by a most insatiable covetousness, divided that among themselves with which all the rest might have been well supplied, are far from that happiness that is enjoyed among the Utopians; for the use as well as the desire of money being extinguished, much anxiety and great occasions of mischief is cut off with it, and who does not see that the frauds, thefts, robberies, quarrels, tumults, contentions, seditions, murders, treacheries, and witchcrafts, which are, indeed, rather punished than restrained by the seventies of law, would all fall off, if money were not any more valued by the world?</p>

<p>Beneficently wilt thou clip All oversteppings of the plumed, The puffed, and bid the masker strip, And into the crowned windbag thrust, Tearing the mortal from the vital thing, A lightning o&#8217;er the half-illumed, Who to base brute-dominion cleave, Yet mark effects, and shun the flash, Till their drowsed wits a beam conceive, To spy a wound without a gash, The magic in a turn of wrist, And how are wedded heart and head regaled When Wit o&#8217;er Folly blows the mort, And their high note of union spreads Wide from the timely word with conquest charged; Victorious laughter, of no loud report, If heard; derision as divinely veiled As terrible Immortals in rose-mist, Given to the vision of arrested men: Whereat they feel within them weave Community its closer threads, And are to our fraternal state enlarged; Like warm fresh blood is their enlivened ken: They learn that thou art not of alien sort, Speaking the tongue by vipers hissed, Or of the frosty heights unsealed, Or of the vain who simple speech distort, Or of the vapours pointing on to nought Along cold skies; though sharp and high thy pitch; As when sole homeward the belated treads, And hears aloft a clamour wailed, That once had seemed the broomstick witch Horridly violating cloud for drought: He, from the rub of minds dispersing fears, Hears migrants marshalling their midnight train; Homeliest order in black sky appears, Not less than in the lighted village steads.</p>

<p>The doctor says it&#8217;s the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter13chapter13:wsuddenlya"><a id="chapter13">Chapter 13: ^[^\w]*Suddenly</a></h2>

<p>) And I fancied she had good shoulders, once upon a time!</p>

<p>Suddenly her heart misgave her.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice made me tremble.</p>

<p>Suddenly turning round he came home.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ossip recovered his faculties.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped; almost retreated.</p>

<p>Suddenly she burst into tears again.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was frightfully broken.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stooped, with a sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright light flashed into his room.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the man shouted: &quot;By George!</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a rustling at the tent-door.</p>

<p>Suddenly Fritz smote on his thigh: &quot;But the guard!</p>

<p>Suddenly she exclaimed: &quot;He is coming down again!</p>

<p>Suddenly D&#8217;Artagnan touched something warm, which moved.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a cry -- it was his daughter&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a dull roar was heard not twenty paces from them.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard Conrad&#8217;s voice: &quot;Come out of it, Annette.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stillness was broken by a challenge,--&#8217;QUI VIVE?</p>

<p>Suddenly a red light appeared ahead, swinging to and fro on the track.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a noise in the porch and a loud cry from the child.</p>

<p>Suddenly I remembered the letter which Vincey had left with the chest.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and the dingy head of Mr. Bloomfield looked in.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.</p>

<p>Suddenly she realized that the matter did not seem to give her much concern.</p>

<p>Suddenly quoth Zayn al-Mawasif to her maid Sukub, &quot;Whither is thy master gone?</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of a peculiar odor in the air--a sweet, sickish odor.</p>

<p>Suddenly the reem awoke, and David found himself high up in the air on its horns.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was pierced by a long, wailing cry from the dark moors outside.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started, saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight.</p>

<p>Suddenly the nightingale stopped, and a voice called out in the distance: &quot;Henriette!</p>

<p>Suddenly Clayton heard the faint report of a firearm--a single shot, and then silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was roused by the sound of the opening gate and of footsteps on the gravel.</p>

<p>Suddenly it stops; you forget it; but all at once it begins again, obliging you to look up.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lid came away, bringing with it a lead lining, such as is usual in tea-chests.</p>

<p>Suddenly the taller members of the crowd turned their heads, and the shorter stood on tiptoe.</p>

<p>Suddenly along the bank, near the village, a barely perceptible shadow appeared on the water.</p>

<p>Suddenly a figure tripped along softly and cautiously through the long feebly lighted corridor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, there came a series of resounding blows upon it, causing the crowd to give back.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dog, who was carrying something in his mouth, began to run around the chairs at full speed.</p>

<p>Suddenly he hurled the body to the floor, and, placing his foot upon the upturned breast, raised his head.</p>

<p>Suddenly the drumming ceased, and in a moment Roger rushed into the room crying as if his heart would break.</p>

<p>Suddenly I began to slide, and I went faster and faster until at last I bumped on the ground, at the very end.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door of the royal apartment opened, and the young king appeared, preceded by two officers of his household.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the symptoms of an approaching illness came over me, which compelled us to return in all haste to Madrid.</p>

<p>Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, she contracted her brows, counterfeited a sigh, and whined: &quot;Ah, I was good-looking then, and desired of all.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in one of the brightest intervals, there came a rift in this curtain, and the summits of a colossal mountain mass appeared.</p>

<p>Suddenly, those same keen instincts within her made her pause in her mad haste, and cower still further within the shadow of the hedge.</p>

<p>Suddenly darting on each other, they closed, and came to the earth, twisted together like twining serpents, in pliant and subtle folds.</p>

<p>Suddenly a more vivid and continuous quiver of violet fire met its reflection on the landscape, and Farina saw the Rhine-stream beneath him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he arose, lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain wore giddy, paced twice or thrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.</p>

<p>Suddenly this morning it occurred to me that you were the man to advise me, so I have hurried to you now, and I place myself unreservedly in your hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly, before she reached the terrace, she heard a firm step upon the crisp gravel, and the next moment her husband&#8217;s figure emerged out of the shadow.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the latter said with an oath: &quot;I was robbed last night; I lost two silver watches, a couple of rings, and about fifty dollars in greenbacks.</p>

<p>Suddenly D&#8217;Artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even Porthos observed; but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before.</p>

<p>Suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass, advanced, grew in size, and as they loomed up larger and larger, assumed the appearance of two horsemen.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he heard a mighty loud cry and turning, saw some black thing, the bigness of a camel or bigger, coming down upon him from the liquid mountain and crying out.</p>

<p>Suddenly she realised that the blank of the last three days had not been the miss of the music, but the miss of HIM; and as she realised this, she unconsciously put her arms about him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the monster reappeared; it crawled slowly across the room and made for the door, as though with some fixed intention, and with a slow movement that was more horrible than ever.</p>

<p>Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly a beautiful delf blue-and-white flower-pot, which had been set on the window-sill of an upper story, fell to the ground with a crash, and the fragments spluttered up round my father&#8217;s legs.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot was heard and then another, a long way off; and for four hours they heard from time to time near or distant reports and rallying cries, strange words of challenge, uttered in guttural voices.</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused, after a few moment of deadly silence, he gave forth a long, low, curious chuckle, while once again Marguerite felt, with a horrible shudder, his thin fingers wandering over her face.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on its sullen stone, I did not indeed see a less negative colour, but I felt as it were an effort towards a less negative colour, the pulsation of a hesitating ray that struggled to discharge its light.</p>

<p>Suddenly the foreman, one Ossip, a cleanly built, upright little peasant with a neatly curling, silvery beard, ruddy cheeks, and a flexible neck, a man everywhere and always in evidence, shouted: &quot;Look alive there, my hearties!</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a clatter, someone ran out of the door of the tavern, slid down the steps, fell headlong at their foot, quickly regained his equilibrium, and disappeared in the darkness after exclaiming in a threatening voice: &quot;Oh, I&#8217;LL pay you out!</p>

<p>Suddenly the attraction ceases, and the oosphere is fertilized, probably at that moment, by the entry of a single antherozoid into the substance of the oosphere; a cell-wall is formed thereupon, in some cases in so short an interval as five minutes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon arrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating him, immediately all submitted to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the father and his three daughters were holding sketch-books in their hands, which they had doubtless carried hidden somewhere in their heavy weather-proof clothes, and were all beginning at once to make pencil sketches of this melancholy and weird place.</p>

<p>Suddenly the track swerved to the right, and as the walls of grain opened out before me, there lay revealed a steppe valley, with, flowing at its bottom, a blue rivulet, and spanning the rivulet, a newly-constructed bridge which, with its reflection in the water, looked as yellow as though fashioned of rope.</p>

<p>Suddenly the light, of which he seemed the centre, turned roseate and began to tremble; then up, far as the men could see, there was flashing of white wings, and coming and going of radiant forms, and voices as of a multitude chanting in unison, &quot;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men!</p>

<p>Suddenly the two youngest seized his hands, and whilst he struggled to release himself, the old woman exclaimed: &quot;You want tobacco, hijo--you come to the Gypsy house to frighten the Callees and the strange Caloro out of their plako-- truly, hijo, we have none for you, and right sorry I am; we have, however, plenty of the dust a su servicio.</p>

<p>Suddenly hereafter he drew his brackmard or horseman&#8217;s sword, wherewith he gave the keeper which held him on the right side such a sound slash that he cut clean through the jugulary veins and the sphagitid or transparent arteries of the neck, with the fore-part of the throat called the gargareon, even unto the two adenes, which are throat kernels; and, redoubling the blow, he opened the spinal marrow betwixt the second and third vertebrae.</p>

<p>But they always became a reality, and were victorious in the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter14chapter14:saida"><a id="chapter14">Chapter 14: said</a></h2>

<p>Quoth Al-Maamun, &#8220;Tell me whichever is the rarer; so Mohammed al-Basri began: &#8221;Know, then, O Commander of the Faithful that there lived once upon a time wealthy man, who was a native of Al-Yaman;but he emigrated from his native land and came to this city of Baghdad, whose sojourn so pleased him that he transported hither his family and possessions.</p>

<p>he said.</p>

<p>said Mousqueton.</p>

<p>said Vera, joyfully.</p>

<p>said not a word more.</p>

<p>No,&quot; said Mrs. Mallowe.</p>

<p>No,&#8217; he said, coming back.</p>

<p>said Maisie, sniffing the air.</p>

<p>This,&#8220; said Ralph, &#8221;to come to Utterbol.</p>

<p>Sun said, &#8220;Oh, no&#8221;; but Coyote insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish no one said any worse of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I suppose he sent the card,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s dear,&#8217; he said, &#8217;on account of the duty.</p>

<p>And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister.</p>

<p>she said, turning on me with her lightning eyes.</p>

<p>And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.</p>

<p>said Lenehan boldly, &quot;I don&#8217;t want an introduction.</p>

<p>Will you then, said the King, have me pay twice the price?</p>

<p>Nay,&#8220; said he,&#8221; he still flies, but it will not last long.</p>

<p>In a decided tone the general said, &quot;I shall say no such thing.</p>

<p>My old grandfather said of Janet, &#8217;She&#8217;s a compassionate thing.</p>

<p>Good-bye,&quot; said Rogojin, pressing it hard, but quite mechanically.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;ll have another sparkling limado, thanks, awfully,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before Glenarvan decides,&#8221; said Paganel, &#8220;I must make an observation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nurse Rollet,&#8220; she said on reaching the nurse&#8217;s, &#8221;I am choking; unlace me!</p>

<p>He&#8217;ll die, most likely,&quot; said the woman with the parasol, in a doleful tone.</p>

<p>3:57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know whom,&#8221; said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under his brows.</p>

<p>Leopold in Julich,&#8220; said Henry&#8217;s agent in Germany, &#8221;is a ferret in a rabbit warren.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was there,&#8221; said Rostov angrily, as if intending to insult the aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>It has been said that great French prose is solely the work of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The same may be said of _The Mill on the Floss_ (1860) and of _Silas Marner_ (1861).</p>

<p>Matthew will come and see me at last,&quot; said Miss Havisham, sternly, when I am laid on that table.</p>

<p>lose not a moment,&quot; said Miss Ophelia; and, stepping across the room, she rapped at St. Clare&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve got that much settled,&#8220; said Sancho; &#8221;get on, brother, for it&#8217;s more bed-time than business-time.</p>

<p>said Aminta, with his last remark at work as the shattering bell of a city&#8217;s insurrection in her breast.</p>

<p>When he had said this, he marched through the whole senate, and carried all the soldiers along with him.</p>

<p>Come, come,&#8220; said Monte Cristo, &#8221;confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in Thomson &amp; French.</p>

<p>Sir Lukin Dunstane, extremely hurried, bumped him on the lower step of the busy Bank, and said: &#8217;Pardon!</p>

<p>Then God said to him: &quot;Grieve not for the loss of the first two tables, which contained only the Ten Commandments.</p>

<p>He said not a word, however, but silently gazed at them through the foliage of the trees, waiting to see what they would do.</p>

<p>We are not obliged to fall back upon some fanciful and unsupported theory of what &#8220;primitive man&#8221; did, and said, and thought.</p>

<p>I have written to my poor mother,&quot; said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Then they saw afore them a knight armed and wounded hard in the body and in the head, that said: O God, succour me for now it is need.</p>

<p>When I received that bullet, I dragged myself here, no one saw me, no one picked me up, I was waiting for you, I said: `So he is not coming!</p>

<p>Say,&#8220; he said, rising, putting a note of determination in his voice which caused her to delay her departure, &#8221;what&#8217;s the matter with you of late?</p>

<p>26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</p>

<p>Milady,&#8220; said the chauffeur, bowing low, &#8221;I have the honor to relate to you that I went to the house of Monsieur Long and found him to be not at home.</p>

<p>Pray do, said I; and he gave his horses a mouthful of bay: and I gave him some cake, and two glasses of Canary wine; and stopt about half an hour in all.</p>

<p>There it is,&#8220; said Sancho, &#8221;what I told you, that you must keep a good count; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no going any farther.</p>

<p>He said &#8220;he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak so loud;&#8221; asking me &quot;whether the king or queen of that country were thick of hearing?</p>

<p>And, therefore, my lord, I do most humbly require, that by your lordship there may be said and declared upon the case what is reasonable, with costs, damages, and interests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,&#8221; said Stryver, squaring his elbows, &#8220;that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon my honour, and the faith I owe my love,&#8220; said I, &#8221;music may be talked of in England, but to possess the very soul of harmony the world should come to the performance of this ode.</p>

<p>For, said he, they trust in their weapons, and in their boldness: but we trust in the Almighty Lord, who at a beck can utterly destroy both them that come against us, and the whole world.</p>

<p>Until the arrival of that remittance,&#8217; said Mrs. Micawber with much feeling, &#8217;I am cut off from my home (I allude to lodgings in Pentonville), from my boy and girl, and from my twins.</p>

<p>I asked him how long he proposed to be away, and he said that by travelling hard he might be back on the fifth day, but there were many miles of marsh to cross before he came to where /She/ was.</p>

<p>Guleesh raised her up on the horse&#8217;s back, and leaped up himself before her, and, &#8220;Rise, horse,&#8221; said he; and his horse, and the other horses with him, went in a full race until they came to the sea.</p>

<p>He put it back again, stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each knee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments, looked round at us and said what follows.</p>

<p>Yet, by the theory, in many other respects they innovate at will, introducing corslets and greaves, said to be unknown to the beginners of the Greek Epics, just as Virgil innovates in bucklers and iron weapons.</p>

<p>Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to go home: and the king&#8217;s son said, &#8216;I shall go and take care of you to your home&#8217;; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived.</p>

<p>But now one came forward and said that the feast was ready; so Robin Hood brought King Richard and those with him to where it lay all spread out on fair white linen cloths which lay upon the soft green grass.</p>

<p>He made no allusion to Rosamond&#8217;s feeling under their trouble, and of Dorothea he only said, &quot;Mrs. Casaubon has been the one person to come forward and say that she had no belief in any of the suspicions against me.</p>

<p>When she had made an end of her verses, she considered her affair and said in herself, &#8217;By Allah, all these things have betided by the ordinance of God the Most High and His providence and this was written and charactered upon the forehead.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crupp said, in the first place, of course it was well known she couldn&#8217;t be expected to wait, but she knew a handy young man, who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it, and whose terms would be five shillings, and what I pleased.</p>

<p>But though his eclectic system failed, the spirit of toleration which originated it produced in other ways many important results, and, indeed, may be said to have done more to establish Akbar&#8217;s power on a secure basis than all his economic and social reforms.</p>

<p>His friend--for De Billy is said to have felt a real attachment to the Count--persisted in his prophecies, telling him that &#8220;birds in the field sang much more sweetly than those in cages,&#8221; and that he would do well to abandon the country before the arrival of Alva.</p>

<p>Then, it is said, after Xerxes had now crossed over the Hellespont, a man of that coast exclaimed: &quot;Why, O Zeus, in the likeness of a Persian man and taking for thyself the name of Xerxes instead of Zeus, art thou proposing to lay waste Hellas, taking with thee all the nations of men?</p>

<p>But if I should say for what reasons the sacred animals have been thus dedicated, I should fall into discourse of matters pertaining to the gods, of which I most desire not to speak; and what I have actually said touching slightly upon them, I said because I was constrained by necessity.</p>

<p>While Jones was admiring these things, and Partridge sat trembling with the firm belief that he was in the house of a witch, the old woman said, &quot;I hope, gentlemen, you will make what haste you can; for I expect my master presently, and I would not for double the money he should find you here.</p>

<p>But the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked Don Quixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought to be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to be added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in the habit of offering to princes.</p>

<p>She got the linen folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took her seat, she called Ulysses: &#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said she, &quot;rise and let us be going back to the town; I will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians.</p>

<p>Madame Stahl talked to Kitty as to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of one&#8217;s youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight of Christ&#8217;s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling--and immediately talked of other things.</p>

<p>The western side of Lake Nyassa, with the exception of the great harbour to the west of Cape Maclear, is, as has been said before, a succession of small bays of nearly similar form, each having an open sandy beach and pebbly shore, and being separated from its neighbour by a rocky headland, with detached rocks extending some distance out to sea.</p>

<p>But he said it warn&#8217;t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; and waited on him first at meals, and didn&#8217;t set down in his presence till he asked them.</p>

<p>Considering myself that what I have said is true, I have always proceeded cautiously in the examination of this account of the prayer and life of this nun, and no one has been more incredulous than myself as to her visions and revelations,--not so, however as to her goodness and her good desires, for herein I have had great experience of her truthfulness, her obedience, mortification, patience, and charity towards her persecutors, and of her other virtues, which any one who will converse with her will discern; and this is what may be regarded as a more certain proof of her real love of God than these visions and revelations.</p>

<p>Sterility or estility,&#8220; answered Pedro, &#8221;it is all the same in the end.</p>

<p>Miss Thorne busied herself among the pansies; and her brother, finding it quite impracticable to give anything of a peculiarly Sunday tone to the conversation, abandoned the attempt, and had it out with the archdeacon about the Bristol guano.</p>

<p>The chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every Saturday night, when work was done, to Chaseborough, a decayed market-town two or three miles distant; and, returning in the small hours of the next morning, to spend Sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the curious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the once independent inns.</p>

<p>This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week -- once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields -- and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village.</p>

<p>In the Kitab Tarykh the following is told: &quot;There was once upon a time a Persian king named Khrosrou, remarkable among all the kings of Persia for his power, his greatness of character, his goodness, and the purity of his morals.</p>

<p>SAVIOLINA.</p>

<p>croud] violin.</p>

<p>ENTER SAVIOLINA.</p>

<p>(The violins begin to play.</p>

<p>The violinists are in their places.</p>

<p>up against the window, with a violin.</p>

<p>[SAVIOLINA LOOKS IN, AND DRAWS BACK AGAIN.</p>

<p>For it cannot be simply his violin playing.</p>

<p>The victim was Tamoszius Kuszleika, who played the violin.</p>

<p>ENTER SAVIOLINA, PUNTARVOLO, FASTIDIOUS BRISK, AND FUNGOSO.</p>

<p>At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet.</p>

<p>I have written violins with mutes as an accompaniment to it.</p>

<p>The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame, to woo, to win it.</p>

<p>28 (the pianoforte sonata in D) to his friend Krumpholz (a violinist).</p>

<p>he cried, flinging the violin on the table and rushing out of the door.</p>

<p>With trembling eagerness he unwrapped the violin and raised it to his chin.</p>

<p>Mussard played the violincello, and was passionately found of Italian music.</p>

<p>Then actors, actresses, Cuigy, Brissaille, Ligniere, the porter, the violinists.</p>

<p>38 trios: 35 with violin and &#8217;cello, 3 with flute and &#8217;cello Only 31 are printed.</p>

<p>When I could see, he had broken it, the neck from the body--the dear old violin!</p>

<p>Then you must of necessity know our court-star there, that planet of wit, madona Saviolina?</p>

<p>At length they ceased, and with a sigh he pressed the violin once, twice, thrice to his lips.</p>

<p>I was glad, and kissed him; and he said, &#8216;This is Sandra&#8217;s gift to me,&#8217; showing the violin.</p>

<p>He can, always, when he pleases; for such a touch on the violin as my father has, you never heard.</p>

<p>There was plenty of singing, and the violins and rebecs, flutes, and reed-pipes were never silent.</p>

<p>The father and four sons played the violin, viola and reboc, and the two daughters sang to the lute and harp.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan sopranists Sassaroli and Tarquinio sang, and the &#8220;incomparable Rolla&#8221; played the solo violin.</p>

<p>The Indians say that always at the same time of the year, soft strains of the violin can be heard near that spot.</p>

<p>She was said to have a weak chest, and like Antonia in the &#8220;Cremona Violin,&#8221; she would die one day while singing.</p>

<p>And how long was Spohr known as an excellent violinist before he had written Faust, Jessonda, and other works?</p>

<p>Arrangements were published of several of these in 3 parts, with violin (or flute), viola or &#8217;cello as principal.</p>

<p>As we drew near, we heard the accustomed sound of violins and guitars, and saw a great motion of the people within.</p>

<p>A few moments later he reappeared with his violin-case a heavy muffler about his neck and thick woollen gloves on his bony hands.</p>

<p>(J. F.-K.) ALARD, JEAN DELPHIN (1815-1888), French violinist and teacher, was born at Bayonne on the 8th of May 1815.</p>

<p>Turning round, he caught sight of the violinist perched on a gray rock, trying vainly to play his dance tunes between gusts of wind.</p>

<p>Translating Moliere is like humming an air one has heard performed by an accomplished violinist of the pure tones without flourish.</p>

<p>THE VIOLINISTS (tuning up): La--la-- CUIGY (to Christian, pointing to the hall, which is filling fast): &#8217;Tis crowded.</p>

<p>She compared herself to her father&#8217;s old broken violin, that might be mended to please the sight; but would never give the tones again.</p>

<p>(To his friend, the admirable violinist Schuppanzigh, when the latter complained of the difficulty of a passage in one of his works.</p>

<p>we Purchased of those people 3 Dogs they gave us High bush cramburies, bread of roots and roots, they were pleased with musick of th violin.</p>

<p>Not so bad a place, after all,&quot; mumbled Peter, as he warmed himself at the fire and the flask; then, taking out his violin, he began to play.</p>

<p>In spite of the poor violin, there was a marvellously touching quality in the music; something new and alluring which had never been heard before.</p>

<p>He left his stamp in 9 symphonies, 5 piano concertos, 10 violin sonatas, 32 piano sonatas, numerous string quartets and dozens of other key works.</p>

<p>He nods and shakes his head at his companions, jerking at them with his violin, until at last the long form of the second violinist also rises up.</p>

<p>The violinist played a tune and the pianiste began hammering the first figure of a quadrille on the piano, to the tune of a most merry Russian song.</p>

<p>If he hears it he will sit outside the door and nod in time to it, while a violin left within his reach is eagerly seized and will be played on through half the night.</p>

<p>His shoulders were broad and strong, and though his limbs were hid by his cassock, his arms showed almost huge, and the violin lay tucked under his chin like a mere toy.</p>

<p>He heard the violinist Mayseder twice, and went to representations of Boieldieu&#8217;s &#8220;La Dame blanche,&#8221; Rossini&#8217;s &#8220;Cenerentola,&#8221; Meyerbeer&#8217;s &#8220;Crociato in Egitto,&#8221; and other operas.</p>

<p>The quality of the notes is very musical; and I do not doubt that a good violinist would be able to give a correct idea of the gibbon&#8217;s composition, excepting as regards its loudness.</p>

<p>As I lay in this manner, groaning over my hapless fate, I heard the sound of a violin, and raising my head, perceived a company of men and women dancing on the grass at some distance from me.</p>

<p>His works have no other special qualities, though it is probable that Mozart&#8217;s first violin sonatas, written at the age of seven, were modelled on Alberti in spite of their superior cleverness.</p>

<p>The violin player, who led the whole band, bewildered by the wind, played at random; his tunes were heard by fits and starts betwixt the noisy gusts, and rose as shrill as the screaming of a sea-gull.</p>

<p>He conducted for various artists, including Barthelemon, the violinist; Haesler, the pianist; and Madam Mara, of whom he tells that she was hissed at Oxford for not rising during the &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; Chorus.</p>

<p>A London Publisher It was about this time too that Haydn opened a correspondence with William Forster of London, who had added to his business of violin-maker that of a music-seller and publisher.</p>

<p>the nativs requested the party to dance which they very readily consented and Peter Cruzat played on the Violin and the men danced Several dances &amp; retired to rest in the houses of the 1st and Second Cheif.</p>

<p>Hearts of wind love not the battle; As though they had no fear of the violins, Which are on the knees of painted women-- Arab women, who were not fed on sheep&#8217;s milk; There is but camel&#8217;s milk in all their land.</p>

<p>The CAPTAIN then proceeds as follows, his song being accompanied by a violin, generally played by the BESSY - Six actors I have brought Who were ne&#8217;er on a stage before; But they will do their best, And they can do no more.</p>

<p>Among the members of the Polish band--which consisted of a leader (Premier), four violins, one oboe, two French horns, three bassoons, and one double bass--we meet with such well-known men as Johann Joachim Quanz and Franz Benda.</p>

<p>Professor Valerius was dead, but his widow remained in France with Daddy Daae and his daughter, who continued to play the violin and sing, wrapping in their dream of harmony their kind patroness, who seemed henceforth to live on music alone.</p>

<p>Many of his works are ingeniously imaginative and innovative, such as his 3rd symphony (the &#8220;Eroica&#8221;), his 9th Violin Sonata (the &#8220;Kreutzer&#8221;), his &#8220;Waldstein&#8221; piano sonata, his 4th and 5th piano concertos, or his &#8220;Grosse Fugue&#8221; for string quartet.</p>

<p>Under Frankh&#8217;s tuition he attained to some proficiency on the violin and the harpsichord, and his voice was so improved that, as an early biographer puts it, he was able to &quot;sing at the parish desk in a style which spread his reputation through the canton.</p>

<p>They have both still further developed their execution, and Chopin is now one of the very first pianoforte- players; he produces as novel effects as Paganini does on the violin, and performs wonders which one would never have imagined possible.</p>

<p>This eminent musician obtained a situation as violinist in the Court Orchestra at Vienna in 1760; and, curiously enough, after many years of professional activity, succeeded Haydn&#8217;s brother, Michael, as Capellmeister to the Bishop of Groswardein in Hungary.</p>

<p>But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told that it was the _andante_ movement of Vinteuil&#8217;s sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret.</p>

<p>Merk began his musical career as a violinist, but being badly bitten in the arm by a big dog, and disabled thereby to hold the violin in its proper position (this is what Fetis relates), he devoted himself to the violoncello, and with such success as to become the first solo player in Vienna.</p>

<p>In the long summer evenings sweet strains of Spanish music from violin and guitar filled the air, and the hard earthen floor of the courtyard resounded to the tap-tap of high-heeled slippers, the swish of silken skirts, and the jingle of silver spurs, as the young people took part in the graceful Spanish dances.</p>

<p>The overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the leader&#8217;s bow across his violin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the Greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to him, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she became as absorbed as before in what was going on.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, in 1791 we hear of Elsner as violinist in Brunn, in 1792 as musical conductor at a theatre in Lemberg--where he is busy composing dramatic and other works--and near the end of the last century as occupant of the same post at the National Theatre in Warsaw, which town became his home for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.</p>

<p>Two other projects of Chopin, however, seem to have remained unrealised--a Concerto for two pianos which he intended to play in public at Vienna with his countryman Nidecki (letter of December 21, 1830), and Variations for piano and violin on a theme of Beethoven&#8217;s, to be written conjointly by himself and Slavik (letters of December 21 and 25, 1830).</p>

<p>Then Tamoszius Kuszleika, after replenishing himself with a pot of beer, returns to his platform, and, standing up, reviews the scene; he taps authoritatively upon the side of his violin, then tucks it carefully under his chin, then waves his bow in an elaborate flourish, and finally smites the sounding strings and closes his eyes, and floats away in spirit upon the wings of a dreamy waltz.</p>

<p>Madam de Warrens sang; Father Cato (whom I have before mentioned, and shall have occasion to speak of again) sang likewise; a dancing--master named Roche, and his son, played on the violin; Canavas, a Piedmontese musician (who was employed like myself in the survey, and has since married at Paris), played on the violoncello; the Abbe Palais performed on the harpsichord, and I had the honor to conduct the whole.</p>

<p>PAGE, ALLEN, AND CRADDOCK.--From Page, read either _Marse Chan_ or _Meh Lady_; from Allen, _King Solomon of Kentucky_, and _Two Gentlemen of Kentucky,_ from _Flute and Violin,_ or _The Kentucky Cardinal,_ or _The Choir Invisible_; from Craddock, selections from _Down the Ravine,_ _In the Tennessee Mountains,_ or _The Prophet of the Great Smoky Mountain._ QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS Poetry.--Which of Poe&#8217;s nine poems indicated for reading pleases you most and which least?</p>

<p>Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood, which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school &#8216;form,&#8217; and &#8216;swore,&#8217; as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her &#8216;faithful&#8217; were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house.</p>

<p>The face of the Countrey, on both Side of the river above and about the falls, is Steep ruged and rockey open and contain but a Small preportion of erbage, no timber a fiew bushes excepted, The nativs at the upper falls raft their timber down Towarnehooks River &amp; those at the narrows take theirs up the river to the lower part of the narrows from this Creek, and Carry it over land 3 miles to their houses &amp;c. at the mouth of this creek Saw Some beaver Sign, and a Small wolf in a Snare Set in the willows The Snars of which I saw Several made for to catch wolves, are made as follows vz: a long pole which will Spring is made fast with bark to a willow, on the top of this pole a String [Clark, October 26, 1805] October 26th 1805 Saturday a fine morning Sent out Six men to hunt deer &amp; Collect rozin to Pitch our Canoes, had all our articles put out to dry- Canoes drawed out and repaired, the injories recved in drawing them over the rocks, every article wet in the Canoe which nearly Sunk yesterday- In the evening 2 Chief and 15 men came over in a Single Canoe, those Chf&#8217;s proved to be the 2 great Chiefs of the tribes above, one gave me a dressed Elk Skin, and gave us Som deer meet, and 2 Cakes of white bread made of white roots, we gave to each Chief a Meadel of the Small Size a red Silk handkerchief &amp; a knife to the 1st a arm ban &amp; a pin of Paint &amp; a Comb to his Son a Piece of riben tied to a tin gorget and 2 hams of Venison They deturmined to Stay with us all night, we had a fire made for them &amp; one man played on the violin which pleased them much my Servent danced- our hunters killed five Deer, 4 verry large gray Squirrels, a goose &amp; Pheasent, one man giged a Salmon trout which we had fried in a little Bears oil which a Chief gave us yesterday and I think the finest fish I ever tasted, Saw great numbers of white Crams flying in Different directions verry high.</p>

<p>And therefore by my will I would have driven him away for jealousy that I had of his life, for it may be no young knight&#8217;s deed that shall enchieve this adventure to the end.</p>

<p>[143] Once upon a time a traveller happened in the region where this animal is found.</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t?</p>

<p>You think...?</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t believe?</p>

<p>You know: lawyers.</p>

<p>You know: lawyers.</p>

<p>You know: lawyers.</p>

<p>You let me alone.</p>

<p>You have disgraced me.</p>

<p>You see this little book?</p>

<p>You have transformed me.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re putting on a screw.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may say you have felt.</p>

<p>&#8217;You can&#8217;t mean Smike?</p>

<p>&#8220;You are devoted to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>--&#8217;You lie, it&#8217;s my bread!</p>

<p>&#8217;You may go to the devil!</p>

<p>You must keep nothing from me.</p>

<p>You see the stairs afore you?</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mad, D&#8217;Artagnan.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&#8217;d like to see it on, sister?</p>

<p>You should not haue beleeued me.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re a remarkably fine fellow.</p>

<p>You never shall again, you dog!</p>

<p>You have not slept, my dear child?</p>

<p>You see, I&#8217;m getting on,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not sanction our project?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew Miss Middleton at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Tommy slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must prove that, monseigneur.&#8221;</p>

<p>You ought to be, for it&#8217;s of your making.</p>

<p>&#8216;You have made them sinful,&#8217; he said.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve thought YOU&#8217;VE known what he&#8217;s worth?</p>

<p>You can stay in the drawing-room, can&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>You will say to me, `But her mother is dead.</p>

<p>You must have thought me a fool and a coward.</p>

<p>You can hear the fish-boats squawking all around us.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are asking too much,&#8221; remonstrated the count.</p>

<p>You had best spare her, sir, for she&#8217;s your son&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never heard any speculation as to what it meant?&#8221;</p>

<p>You go and see him, my lad,&quot; said he as he took his leave.</p>

<p>You call my blood into my face with mentioning that traitor.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re not so hurried now, Rachael, and your hand is cooler.</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t get anything unless you start working very seriously.</p>

<p>You are the cause,&#8220; said she, &#8221;that I am now in this position.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are writing the prologue to the &#8216;Facheux,&#8217; are you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>You hold up your jewel to the enemy, and cry, &#8217;Come and take it.</p>

<p>You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;You have done a good deal of digging by your callosities.&#8221;</p>

<p>You should furnish him with some of course,&quot; replied Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>You are entirely mistaken in ascribing treachery to him,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not ask me, because I would not do it, Monsieur Fouquet.&#8221;</p>

<p>You got a letter just before dinner, I believe,&#8217; began the eldest sister.</p>

<p>You know that many men are for you; but you know not how many nor how good.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll probably think of some place to go to while you&#8217;re moving,&quot; said Dick.</p>

<p>You can see from their names that Nafferton had the race-advantage of Pinecoffin.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.</p>

<p>You will keep everything during your life, and I will give you the thirty crowns a month.</p>

<p>You think I mean by that that I think your friend isn&#8217;t good enough to marry my daughter.</p>

<p>You are first and above all things the proud, cold queen, and next, next the loving woman.</p>

<p>You must leave in this ball an opening to serve as a fusee, and cover it with rosin and sulphur.</p>

<p>You didn&#8217;t ever wear ear-rings,&quot; he said, taking hold of her small ear with his coarse fingers.</p>

<p>You see I am calm; calm, too, they say, is the shuddering land through which the plague has swept.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so like her now,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;that sometimes I think perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll never look finished if you are not careful about the little details, for they make up the pleasing whole.</p>

<p>You will find that the clips are too wide for your nose, showing that the lady&#8217;s nose was very broad at the base.</p>

<p>You shall do [-that which-] {+what+} the Council of [-Vocations-] {+Vocation+} shall prescribe for you.</p>

<p>You must (Sir) change persons with me, ere you make that my report: you indeede spoke so of him, and much more, much worse Luc.</p>

<p>You will hear a clock strike in a few minutes,&#8220; said the girl, with her soft, charming accent, &#8221;but I rely upon your honor not to remove the handkerchiefs until then.</p>

<p>You know,&#8220; said Aerssens, writing to the French ambassador at the Hague, de Russy, &#8221;that it is the Advocate alone that has the universal knowledge of the outside and the inside of our commonwealth.</p>

<p>You will fall into everlasting pain, torture, and unrest if you do not break your will and repent, so that you may be accepted and forgiven by those you have offended, and who have done so much for you.</p>

<p>You have subjugated the Scheldt, and forced it to bear its bridge, notwithstanding the strength of its current, the fury of the ocean-tides, the tremendous power of the icebergs, the perpetual conflicts with our fleets.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter18chapter18:wandthena"><a id="chapter18">Chapter 18: ^[^\w]*And then</a></h2>

<p>Once upon a time, I may tell you, an anchorite happened to be on his travels; and as the people came pressing around him, and kneeling to him, and tearfully beseeching him with the words, &#8217;0h holy father, intercede for us with the wolves which are devouring our substance!</p>

<p>And then, presto!</p>

<p>And then the policemen!</p>

<p>And then Dr Thorne arrived.</p>

<p>And then one day Chopin proposed.</p>

<p>And then either gat another spear.</p>

<p>And then I heard a voice say, `Mme.</p>

<p>And then the noble knight&#8217;s heart burst.</p>

<p>And then he departed about the hour of noon.</p>

<p>And then his life was, you might say, crossed.</p>

<p>And then she did think for one moment of herself.</p>

<p>And then the King and Jack shook hands together.</p>

<p>And then he talked of her mother, and he made her pray.</p>

<p>And then they moved on quickly, and the misery was soon over.</p>

<p>And then, too, there is a cabin taken for me on board the SCOTIA.</p>

<p>And then, back in my bed, I felt so sick that I could not get up.</p>

<p>And then we are obliged to recollect ourselves, saying, &quot;Where was I?</p>

<p>And then it waxed clear day, and Sir Palomides entered into the castle.</p>

<p>And then he went at full into the comparative geology of the two regions.</p>

<p>And then he had no proof of any promise; he could not force the bishop to appoint him.</p>

<p>And then Sir Launcelot returned unto Dame Bragwaine, and she thanked him of his great labour.</p>

<p>And then anon he made him ready, and armed him at all points, and took his horse and his shield.</p>

<p>And then for suitors proud and high, To bend before my conquering eye,-- Thou, flattering bard!</p>

<p>And then he came, and she asked him what he was, and of what place, and where about he went to seek.</p>

<p>And then Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.</p>

<p>And then she told herself that John would have a better chance if he had been content to plead for himself.</p>

<p>And then again came Ona&#8217;s scream, smiting him like a blow in the face, making him wince and turn white.</p>

<p>And then I go the furthest off To counteract a knock; Then draw my little letter forth And softly pick its lock.</p>

<p>And then he gat another great spear, and smote down twelve knights, and the most part of them never throve after.</p>

<p>And then for pity Sir Launcelot withheld his knights, and suffered King Arthur&#8217;s party for to withdraw them aside.</p>

<p>And then Sir Ector came again and gave Sir Palomides such a dash with a sword that he stooped down upon his saddle bow.</p>

<p>And then Mr Toogood had only written one short scrap of a letter--just three words, and they were written in triumph.</p>

<p>And then he looked on his armour, and understood he was well armed, and therewith blessed him and mounted upon his horse.</p>

<p>And then she was ware where came his horse ever after that chariot, and ever he trod his guts and his paunch under his feet.</p>

<p>And then--something--moved beneath them, there was a gasp and a cry--and somebody said in muffled accents: &quot;Merciful goodness!</p>

<p>&#8220;And then they took me, Brument by the head, and Cornu by the feet, as one might take, for instance, a sheet that has been washed.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?</p>

<p>And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods.</p>

<p>And then that match was made, which, uniting his and Pompey&#8217;s power, had well-nigh ruined the Roman empire, and did destroy the commonwealth.</p>

<p>And then Sir Gawaine and Sir Bors did their message, and commanded Lucius, in Arthur&#8217;s name to avoid his land, or shortly to address him to battle.</p>

<p>And then another difficulty of huge dimensions arose, a difficulty which Mr Plomacy had indeed foreseen, and for which he was in some sort provided.</p>

<p>And then you will order all my actions; and I shall be certain that they are such as I would proudly call mine; and I shall be shut away from the world.</p>

<p>And then Sir Tristram put his spear from him, and put Sir Palomides again on horseback, and Sir Launcelot put King Arthur on horseback and so departed.</p>

<p>And then a muffled scream came from the cavernous mouth of the dark hole beyond the sacrificial altar through which the priestess had entered the temple.</p>

<p>And then Kulan Tith told of the savage calot that fought beside me, and after that I saw suspicion in the eyes of Matai Shang--or did I but imagine it?</p>

<p>And then Jurgis would drop his work, whatever it was, and come, and the other would say, &quot;Comrade Jurgis, just tell these gentlemen what you saw on the killing-beds.</p>

<p>And then she fell to thinking what she should do if--if anything happened to poor good Rawdon, and what a great piece of luck it was that he had left his horses behind.</p>

<p>And then all our victuals in beggar&#8217;s attire, At the hands of good people we then did require; At last into England, as now it is seen, We came, and remained in Bednall Green.</p>

<p>And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid.</p>

<p>And then came the lightning-flash of the gala performance: the heavens torn asunder and an angel&#8217;s voice heard upon earth for the delight of mankind and the utter capture of his heart.</p>

<p>And then our servants, too, will know, generally, the times of their business, and the hours of their leisure or recess; and we, as well as they, shall reap the benefits of this regularity.</p>

<p>And then Sir Blamore and Sir Tristram kissed together, and there they made their oaths that they would never none of them two brethren fight with Sir Tristram, and Sir Tristram made the same oath.</p>

<p>And then waxing enthusiastic, and warming more and more into German gutturals and pronunciation, the good Doctor would lift up his hands, with two great rings on his thumbs, and exclaim: &quot;Und Du!</p>

<p>And then would he upon his Bible seek That ilke* proverb of Ecclesiast, *same Where he commandeth, and forbiddeth fast, Man shall not suffer his wife go roll about.</p>

<p>And then she called her father, Sir Bernard, and her brother, Sir Tirre, and heartily she prayed her father that her brother might write a letter like as she did indite it: and so her father granted her.</p>

<p>And then the poet, in an access of patriotism, cries out: &quot;And what, in fine, art thou, O Israel, but a poor _Bahur_ among the peoples, eating one day with one of them, another day with the other!...</p>

<p>And then I stole all Courtesie from Heauen, And drest my selfe in such Humilitie, That I did plucke Allegeance from mens hearts, Lowd Showts and Salutations from their mouthes, Euen in the presence of the Crowned King.</p>

<p>And then Sir Launcelot took the best horse that he found, and loosed Sir Palomides and set him upon that horse; and so they returned again unto Joyous Gard, and then was Sir Palomides ware of Sir Tristram how he came riding.</p>

<p>And then came in the postilion, and two helpers, (for my master has both here, and at Lincolnshire, fine hunting horses; and it is the chief sport he takes delight in,) as also the scullion-boy: And I said, How do all of you?</p>

<p>And then they pulled out their swords, and dressed their shields, and lashed together mightily as mighty knights, that well-nigh there was no piece of harness would hold them, for this Corsabrin was a passing felonious knight.</p>

<p>And then the Lord will shew these things, and the majesty of the Lord shall appear, and there shall be a cloud as it was also shewed to Moses, and he shewed it when Solomon prayed that the place might be sanctified to the great God.</p>

<p>And then the flowery garland she tied upon his head, &#8220;Thy face is delicate and fair as Ganymede&#8217;s,&#8221; she said; &quot;And if great Jove beheld thee now, he&#8217;d send his eagle down, To take thee to the palace halls that high Olympus crown.</p>

<p>And then I threw myself at his feet, blessed God, and blessed him for his goodness; and he overwhelmed me with kindness, calling me his sweet bride, and twenty lovely epithets, that swell my grateful heart beyond the power of utterance.</p>

<p>And then, examining the Princess&#8217;s headdress, &quot;Why, you&#8217;re quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts, no,--oh, it&#8217;s a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what was going to be on my programme?</p>

<p>And then came into the field Sir Perimones, the Red Knight, Sir Persant&#8217;s brother, that was a knight of the castle, and he encountered with Sir Ector de Maris, and either smote other so hard that both their horses and they fell to the earth.</p>

<p>And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn&#8217;t be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be better then.</p>

<p>And then by little and little I recovered my former thoughts of Thy handmaid, her holy conversation towards Thee, her holy tenderness and observance towards us, whereof I was suddenly deprived: and I was minded to weep in Thy sight, for her and for myself, in her behalf and in my own.</p>

<p>And then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was by tearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, and making eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served him for a rosary all the time he was there, during which he repeated countless ave-marias.</p>

<p>And then came the terrible news that the whole world was gathering in arms against us; I could not deny that these were important matters, but still I felt certain, if all went well, a time would come at last when you need not grudge me your company, and we should be together to my heart&#8217;s content, you and I.</p>

<p>And then they returned to terra firma, that is to say, to some passage that led them to the little girls&#8217; dancing-school, where brats between six and ten were practising their steps, in the hope of becoming great dancers one day, &#8220;covered with diamonds....&#8221; Meanwhile, Christine gave them sweets instead.</p>

<p>And then she slept; and then she rose refreshed; and met her father with her kindest embrace and most loving smiles; and on the whole their breakfast was by no means so triste as had been their dinner the day before; and then, making some excuse to her father for so soon leaving him, she started on the commencement of her operations.</p>

<p>And then on four different times the two ladies had to retire into Mrs Broughton&#8217;s room in order that Jael might be arrayed in various costumes--and in each costume she had to kneel down, taking the hammer in her hand, and holding the pointed stick which had been prepared to do duty as the nail, upon the forehead of the dummy Sisera.</p>

<p>And then, despite the nakedness and poverty wherein they had first seen us, they would have it that we were gods sent down to them from the world beyond the mountains by their fathers of old time; for of Holy Church, and the Blessed Trinity, and the Mother of God they knew no more than did I at that time, but were heathen, as the Gentiles of yore agone.</p>

<p>And then he said, My name is Sir Pelleas, born in the Isles, and of many isles I am lord, and never have I loved lady nor damosel till now in an unhappy time; and, sir knight, since ye are so nigh cousin unto King Arthur, and a king&#8217;s son, therefore betray me not but help me, for I may never come by her but by some good knight, for she is in a strong castle here, fast by within this four mile, and over all this country she is lady of.</p>

<p>And then when they had discussed all this, when the father had told all to the child, she could not be less confiding than he had been; and as John Bold&#8217;s name was mentioned between them, she owned how well she had learned to love him--&#8216;had loved him once,&#8217; she said, &#8217;but she would not, could not do so now--no, even had her troth been plighted to him, she would have taken it back again--had she sworn to love him as his wife, she would have discarded him, and not felt herself forsworn, when he proved himself the enemy of her father.</p>

<p>And then I found my Lord Sandwich, his title under his armes is, &#8220;The most noble and mighty Lord, Edward, Earl of Sandwich, &amp;c.&#8221; Sir Edward Walker afterwards coming in, in discourse did say that there was none of the families of princes in Christendom that do derive themselves so high as Julius Caesar, nor so far by 1000 years, that can directly prove their rise; only some in Germany do derive themselves from the patrician familys of Rome, but that uncertainly; and, among other things, did much inveigh against the writing of romances, that 500 years hence being wrote of matters in general, true as the romance of Cleopatra, the world will not know which is the true and which the false.</p>

<p>But when mature, married and discreet people arrange a match between a boy and a girl, they do it sensibly, with a view to the future, and the young couple live happily ever afterwards.</p>

<p>And he went contrary to his wife and persisted in buying stolen goods below their value till he fell under suspicion and perished therefor: even as perished the sparrow in the tale of THE SPARROW AND THE PEACOCK There was once upon a time a sparrow, that used every day to visit a certain king of the birds and ceased not to wait upon him in the mornings and not to leave him till the evenings, being the first to go in and the last to go out.</p>

<p>De Spermate, to aver with boldness that it were better, that is to say, a less evil, to have no heart at all than to be quite destitute of genitories; for there is laid up, conserved, and put in store, as in a secessive repository and sacred warehouse, the semence and original source of the whole offspring of mankind.</p>

<p>we were now about to penetrate a country at least two thousand miles in width, on which the foot of civillized man had never trodden; the good or evil it had in store for us was for experiment yet to determine, and these little vessells contained every article by which we were to expect to subsist or defend ourselves.</p>

<p>In those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers except the legislative boldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil.</p>

<p>The dogs were not an unmixed evil, for, by sleeping on and around him, they kept him warm at night; but, as an offset to this good service, they walked, ran, and jumped over him as he lay, snatched the food from his birchen dish, or, in a mad rush at some bone or discarded morsel, now and then overset both dish and missionary.</p>

<p>Let us put it at the worst: suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this, and that my conscience will reproach me for it some day, to accept, for the good of others, these reproaches which weigh only on myself; this evil action which compromises my soul alone; in that lies self-sacrifice; in that alone there is virtue.</p>

<p>De Wardes, irritated at finding himself dragged away in so abrupt a manner by this Englishman, had sought in his subtle mind for some means of escaping from his fetters; but no one having rendered him any assistance in this respect, he was absolutely obliged, therefore, to submit to the burden of his own evil thoughts and caustic spirit.</p>

<p>Evil spirits were a later invention, and their operations were even then confined chiefly to tearing people&#8217;s hearts out, and so forth, for their own particular pleasure; we certainly meet no cases of evil spirits wishing to undermine man&#8217;s allegiance to God, or desiring to make people wicked in order to secure their everlasting punishment.</p>

<p>Now I knew thee to be an evil doer when thou diddest to me what thou didst, and know, that when I have cast thee back into the sea, I will warn whomsoever may fish thee up of what hath befallen me with thee, and I will advise him to toss thee back again; so shalt thou abide here under these waters till the End of Time shall make an end of thee.</p>

<p>I gave her the eight francs and asked her to take care of the money because I could get no more; and then I kissed her and said that she was not to suppose I kissed her with any evil motives or because I was in love with her, for that I did so solely out of pity for her, and because from the first I had not accounted her as guilty so much as unfortunate.</p>

<p>Master, I know not which are the worst plagues, friars, curates, or sparrows: &quot;May the Lord God preserve us from evil birds three: From all friars and curates and sparrows that be; For the sparrows eat up all the corn that we sow, The friars drink down all the wine that we grow, Whilst the curates have all the fair dames at their nod: From these three evil curses preserve us, Lord God.</p>

<p>Then from Thermodon, from broad-sweeping streams, Came, clothed upon with beauty of Goddesses, Penthesileia -- came athirst indeed For groan-resounding battle, but yet more Fleeing abhorred reproach and evil fame, Lest they of her own folk should rail on her Because of her own sister&#8217;s death, for whom Ever her sorrows waxed, Hippolyte, Whom she had struck dead with her mighty spear, Not of her will -- &#8217;twas at a stag she hurled.</p>

<p>Let such who are wont to admire things daring and forbidden, know, that even under evil Princes great men may be produced, and that by the means of modesty and observance, provided these be accompanied with application and vigour, they may rise to an equal measure of public estimation and praise with that of many, who through a conduct very stubborn and precipitate, but of no advantage to the Commonweal, have distinguished themselves by dying only to gain a great name.</p>

<p>A man, for instance, kills himself under the compulsion of another man, who twists round his right hand, wherewith he happened to have taken up a sword, and forces him to turn the blade against his own heart; or, again, he may be compelled, like Seneca, by a tyrant&#8217;s command, to open his own veins - that is, to escape a greater evil by incurring, a lesser; or, lastly, latent external causes may so disorder his imagination, and so affect his body, that it may assume a nature contrary to its former one, and whereof the idea cannot exist in the mind (III:x.</p>

<p>Now as to those Eretrians who had been reduced to slavery, Datis and Artaphrenes, when they reached Asia in their voyage, brought them up to Susa; and king Dareios, though he had great anger against the Eretrians before they were made captive, because the Eretrians had done wrong to him unprovoked, yet when he saw that they had been brought up to him and were in his power, he did them no more evil, but established them as settlers in the Kissian land upon one of his own domains, of which the name is Ardericca: and this is distant two hundred and ten furlongs from Susa and forty from the well which produces things of three different kinds; for they draw from it asphalt, salt and oil, in the manner which here follows:--the liquid is drawn with a swipe, to which there is fastened half a skin instead of a bucket, and a man strikes this down into it and draws up, and then pours it into a cistern, from which it runs through into another vessel, taking three separate ways.</p>

<p>To the European mind it seems natural to rank myths of the gods before myths of the making or the evolution of the world, because our religion, like that of the more philosophic Greeks, makes the deity the fount of all existences, causa causans, &#8220;what unmoved moves,&#8221; the beginning and the end.</p>

<p>But now they must go on their way; so they asked his leave to depart from Guivret, in whom they had found a friend indeed; for he had honoured and served them in every way.</p>

<p>But for the meanwhile he was satisfied with the concessions of Austria: that power, in the expectation of being supported by England, asked her on what terms she was to treat.</p>

<p>He might somehow show a preference-- distinguishing between them; might, out of pity for her, signal to her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than he asked.</p>

<p>He adds:--&quot;An old Indian was asked what was the reason of the noises in this place, to which he replied that the Indian&#8217;s god was angry because Englishman&#8217;s god was come here.</p>

<p>I, too, was asked to look; the good brother who conducted me to the plain, unpainted pine coffin remarking very sensibly that &quot;the body is not of much importance after it is dead.</p>

<p>1:20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</p>

<p>I thought somehow that the cook had a sly grin on his face when he brought what I asked for, but with the thirst I had after the stiff march, I gave a great part of my attention to the drink.</p>

<p>Gunnar rode from home two nights afterwards, and two men with him; they rode along until they got on Bluewoodheath and then men on horseback met them and asked who that tall man might be of whom so little was seen.</p>

<p>The king himself asked the Bráhman why he did not eat his food, though it was sweet and fragrant, and he slowly answered him, &quot;I perceive in this food an evil smell of the reek from corpses, so I cannot bring myself to eat it, however delicious it may be.</p>

<p>Suspecting once, during a journey, that his mule-driver had alighted to shoe his mules, only in order to have an opportunity for allowing a person they met, who was engaged in a law-suit, to speak to him, he asked him, &quot;how much he got for shoeing his mules?</p>

<p>These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart- watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns.</p>

<p>But when he observed in one corner of the vessel the little trunk in which she used to keep her jewels, which he well knew he had left in Algiers and had not brought to the garden, he was still more amazed, and asked her how that trunk had come into our hands, and what there was in it.</p>

<p>I was mortified at this piece of simplicity, which I imagined, at that time, was all affected by way of reprimand for my folly; and asked with some heat if he thought I had spent the evening in a cellar with chairmen and bunters; giving him to know, at the same time, that my expense had amounted to eighteen guineas.</p>

<p>[319] The concubine of Eliphaz was Timna, a princess of royal blood, who had asked to be received into the faith of Abraham and his family, but they all, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, had rejected her, and she said, &#8220;Rather will I be a maid servant unto the dregs of this nation, than mistress of another nation,&#8221; and so she was willing to be concubine to Eliphaz.</p>

<p>The sorcerer turned to me and said: “Hear you what they have replied; that in the space of one month you will be where she is?” Then once more he prayed me to stand firm by him, because the legions were a thousandfold more than he had summoned, and were the most dangerous of all the denizens of hell; and now that they had settled what I asked, it behoved us to be civil to them and dismiss them gently.</p>

<p>If the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty, disaster, starvation, disease, degradation, death, thither were these half-dozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with them--six helpless creatures, who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms, much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of Durbeyfield.</p>

<p>It is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before, and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream, affirming that cows require less food if kept cold, and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he asked for wages just as under the old system, and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits.</p>

<p>Having been officially asked at the time whether I would guide a party into the country, and having drawn up (at the request of the general officer) plans for the purpose, and having given it as my opinion that it would not only have been feasible but easy to have marched a force in peace and safety to Tumloong, I feel it incumbent on me here to remark, that I think General Napier, who never was in Sikkim, and wrote from many hundred miles&#8217; distance, must have misapprehended the state of the case.</p>

<p>He asked himself (he had often asked himself before but had never put it into words) what it was in her that filled him with such extravagant delight; he did not know; he knew only that when she was with him he was happy, and when she was away from him the world was on a sudden cold and gray; he knew only that when he thought of her his heart seemed to grow big in his body so that it was difficult to breathe (as if it pressed against his lungs) and it throbbed, so that the delight of her presence was almost pain; his knees shook, and he felt strangely weak as though, not having eaten, he were tremulous from want of food.</p>

<p>Had they risked the dangerous alternative, it might have ensured the triumph of the whole enterprise, while their actual decision proved most disastrous in the end.</p>

<p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer&#8217;s lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm&#8217;d, And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance, or nature&#8217;s changing course untrimm&#8217;d: But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#8217;st, Nor shall death brag thou wander&#8217;st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#8217;st, So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>

<p>Mr. Apthorp told of his own similar struggle, and how he had entered a public school and sat for months with ten-year-old-boys, reciting their lessons and catching their phrases.</p>

<p>The 68-year-old President stood outside for the entire proceeding, greeted crowds of well-wishers at the White House later that day, and attended several celebrations that evening.</p>

<p>He thought it natural that the Government should send him out as an adventurer also, with a twenty-three-year-old son, and he did not even notice that he left not a friend behind him.</p>

<p>COLONEL ASTOR John Jacob Astor was returning from a trip to Egypt with his nineteen-year-old bride, formerly Miss Madeline Force, to whom he was married in Providence, September 9, 1911.</p>

<p>Little did she know that the object of her little five-year-old skeptic was to present the test to their father and mother, to see whether they were one, and found the same result each time.</p>

<p>The little five-year-old boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, and chilled with terror, jogged his brother&#8217;s elbow; but the elder brother had already shut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered.</p>

<p>The three-year-old wethers and older oxen that used to be common in the fat stock markets are now rarely seen, excepting perhaps in the case of mountain breeds of sheep and Highland cattle.</p>

<p>The Fourth of July LEGENDS OF THE OLD PLANTATION I UNCLE REMUS INITIATES THE LITTLE BOY One evening recently, the lady whom Uncle Remus calls &#8220;Miss Sally&#8221; missed her little seven-year-old.</p>

<p>There was no telling what the outcome would have been, for the third wolf joined the elder, and together, old leader and young leader, they attacked the ambitious three-year-old and proceeded to destroy him.</p>

<p>From time to time her son Charles, whose affection and sympathy for his mother in her many tribulations were always pronounced, went on to see her, and in May, 1850, he took with him his twelve-year-old son.</p>

<p>Sure me fawther got a goold medal (and his Excellency himself eat a slice of it, and said never was finer mate in his loif) for a four-year-old heifer, the like of which ye never saw in this country any day.</p>

<p>Five minutes later little black-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her father&#8217;s pet, having learned from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran to her father unobserved by her mother.</p>

<p>Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther&#8217;s point of view (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could wish to avoid.</p>

<p>The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing boston at the clubs.</p>

<p>At the age of thirty-four, and apparently at first sight, he suddenly married Mary Powell, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a royalist country gentleman with whom his family had long maintained some business and social relations.</p>

<p>Jane Grey, the sixteen-year-old bride of a few days, was summoned to the throne by the Council; every person about her implored her to claim what they called her right and fulfil her duty in accepting the crown: what else could she do?</p>

<p>And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old creatures--instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die.</p>

<p>Nineteen-year-old Sanchez did not indeed care for her hand, but merely for her love, and when it began to grow dusk, he stationed himself on the balcony which he had discovered, made signs to her, and flung flowers or bonbons on her table.</p>

<p>The lilac bushes that formed the hedge were in full bloom, as they had been when, 14 years ago, Nekhludoff had played gorelki with the 15-year-old Katusha, and had fallen and got his hand stung by the nettles behind one of those lilac bushes.</p>

<p>said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.</p>

<p>She was much better fitted for the task than Marilla, for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive understanding of the curious ideas that seven-year-olds sometimes get about matters that are, of course, very plain and simple to grown up people.</p>

<p>The grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty-year-old heels, and began to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more: &quot;Ainsi, bornant les cours de tes revasseries, Alcippe, il est donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries.</p>

<p>On the seat in front sat their children--a well-dressed little girl, with loose, fair hair, and as fresh as a flower, who also held a bright parasol, and an eight-year-old boy, with a long, thin neck and sharp collarbones, a sailor hat with long ribbons on his head.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV JACK THAYER&#8217;S OWN STORY OF THE WRECK Seventeen-year-old son of Pennsylvania Railroad official tells moving story of his rescue--Told mother to be brave--Separated from parents-- Jumped when vessel sank--Drifted on overturned boat--Picked up by Carpathia.</p>

<p>Napoleon with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his former agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued orders- as the historians tell us- to retreat by the Smolensk road.</p>

<p>Next to him sat a University student who was coaching him, and Missy&#8217;s cousin, Michael Sergeivitch Telegin, generally called Misha; opposite him, Katerina Alexeevna, a 40-year-old maiden lady, a Slavophil; and at the foot of the table sat Missy herself, with an empty place by her side.</p>

<p>I have seen twelve-year-old boys working in chains on the public streets of Atlanta, directly in front of the schools, in company with old and hardened criminals; and this indiscriminate mingling of men and women and children makes the chain-gangs perfect schools of crime and debauch- ery.</p>

<p>Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who thought they could.</p>

<p>Both sexes of the wild turkey are ultimately furnished with a tuft of bristles on the breast, but in two-year-old birds the tuft is about four inches long in the male and hardly apparent in the female; when, however, the latter has reached her fourth year, it is from four to five inches in length.</p>

<p>The Mikados of Japan seem early to have resorted to the expedient of transferring the honours and burdens of supreme power to their infant children; and the rise of the Tycoons, long the temporal sovereigns of the country, is traced to the abdication of a certain Mikado in favour of his three-year-old son.</p>

<p>During the long, bright summer nights, when the sun scarcely dips beneath the horizon and reappears in an hour, clothed in the breezy garments of morning, she was permitted to frolic, race, and play all sorts of improvised games with a shaggy, little, plebeian three-year-old colt whom she had condescended to honor with her acquaintance.</p>

<p>Then came the verdict, delivered from rolling clouds: &quot;If you were only a mass of blathering vanity, Dick, I wouldn&#8217;t mind,--I&#8217;d let you go to the deuce on your own mahl-stick; but when I consider what you are to me, and when I find that to vanity you add the twopenny- halfpenny pique of a twelve-year-old girl, then I bestir myself in your behalf.</p>

<p>Not only Princess Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old &#8220;Prince Nicholas&#8221; (as his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his arms, and Michael Ivanovich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.</p>

<p>Like all Mr. Everett&#8217;s orations, it was an admirable piece of oratory, such as only an admirable orator and scholar could create; too good for a ten-year-old boy to appreciate at its value; but already the boy knew that the dead President could not be in it, and had even learned why he would have been out of place there; for knowledge was beginning to come fast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna Mikhaylovna&#8217;s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count&#8217;s eldest son; Sonya, the count&#8217;s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Petya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces.</p>

<p>Then he would be seen triumphantly telling his mates of his success; then, I would find myself feeling acutely conscious of the fact that everyone was despising me for my complacence Yes, grown sick beyond endurance with a yearning for some thing which it could not descry, my fifteen-year-old heart would dissolve in a flood of mortified tears, and there would pass through my brain the despondent, aching thought: &quot;Oh, what a sad, uncomfortable world is this!</p>

<p>In his leisure time he scraped and polished the horn, fitted it with a wooden stopper and cord, and with greatest care and labor scratched upon its gleaming surface these words: Jabez Rockwell, Ridgeway, Conn--His Horn Made in Camp at Valley Forge Thin and pale, but with unbroken spirit, this sixteen-year-old veteran drilled and marched and braved picket duty in zero weather, often without a scrap of meat to brace his ration for a week on end; but he survived with no worse damage than sundry frost-bites.</p>

<p>But love for a parent is not merely duty But a great success is full of temptations But what is it we do (excepting cricket, of course) But is there such a thing as happiness But had sunk to climb on a firmer footing By our manner of loving we are known By forbearance, put it in the wrong By resisting, I made him a tyrant By nature incapable of asking pardon Cajoled like a twenty-year-old yahoo at college Call of the great world&#8217;s appetite for more (Invented news) Calm fanaticism of the passion of love Can you not be told you are perfect without seeking to improve Can believe a woman to be any age when her cheeks are tinted Can a man go farther than his nature?</p>

<p>John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.</p>

<p>I showed this scribble to Madam de Merveilleux, who, instead of discouraging me, as she ought to have done, laughed heartily at my sarcasms, as well as her son, who, I believe, did not like M. Godard; indeed, it must be confessed, he was a man not calculated to obtain affection.</p>

<p>Then she stayed him, and laughed sweetly in his face, and said: &quot;It is a long while now since the beginning of the June day, and meseems I know thy lack, and the slaking of it lieth somewhat nearer than Hampton under Scaur, which we shall not reach these two days if we go afoot all the way.</p>

<p>I had a bed put up for him in my room.... Well, we went to bed, smoked, chatted--about the fair sex for the most part, as is only suitable in bachelor company--we laughed, of course; I saw Vassily Vassilitch put out his candle and turn his back towards me: as much as to say: &#8217;Good night.</p>

<p>CXIX Zerbino laughed parforce, when he descried That beldam&#8217;s face, though he was full of rage; For too ill-sorted seemed her vest of pride With her foul visage, more deformed by age; And to the proud Marphisa, at her side The prince, exclaimed, &quot;Sir warrior, you are sage, In having chosen damsel of a sort, Whom none, I ween, will grudge you should escort.</p>

<p>They all laughed, and the Distressed One continued: &quot;And this same horse, if so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to our sufferings, will be here before us ere the night shall have advanced half an hour; for he announced to me that the sign he would give me whereby I might know that I had found the knight I was in quest of, would be to send me the horse wherever he might be, speedily and promptly.</p>

<p>No living thing was there beside one woman, Whom I found wandering in the streets, and she Was withered from a likeness of aught human _2760 Into a fiend, by some strange misery: Soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me, And glued her burning lips to mine, and laughed With a loud, long, and frantic laugh of glee, And cried, &#8217;Now, Mortal, thou hast deeply quaffed _2765 The Plague&#8217;s blue kisses--soon millions shall pledge the draught!</p>

<p>The Caliph began to be thoughtful and asked about the trees and the qualities of the flowers and the fruits and the nature of their colours, and as the Caliph took pleasure in that, he walked around for an hour and then passed over to the palaces and houses, going from place to place, from quarter to quarter, and from market to market; and, whilst they were going on, they stopped before a bookshop and the Caliph opened a book-case and began to turn over the books one by one, and taking one in his hand opened it, began to read in it, and then suddenly laughed until he fell upon his back.</p>

<p>Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a loo her

because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window

lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up

Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that

them like that a bit on my side piano quietly sweeeee theres that train far away pianissimo eeeee one more song that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh place I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all IS at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at I S my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose 111 have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow 111 have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart SWEETheart he always sang it not like Bartell Darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from I years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent I atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is I s l o fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want LI or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.</p>

<p>Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end.</p>
