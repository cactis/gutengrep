Why did you make a secret of it to make the man think his nonsense?--

Why, at the intersections _a_, _b_ of the two compound shadows _e f_
and _m e_, is a simple shadow pfoduced as at _e h_ and _m g_, while no

"Why, sir, you know how old Mrs. Bates is, and my young lady is always

Why should not variations occur during an early period of development,
having no relation to reversion; yet such variations might be
preserved and accumulated, if in any way serviceable, for instance, in
shortening and simplifying the course of development?

respect to the form of transmission, one important determining cause
seems to be the age at which the variations first appear.

Why the nobility and gentry of this burg should think that I'm their
affinity just because I've got golden hair--which is perfectly
genuine, Mac; I can show you the pedigree--and because I earn an

Why, no more nor less, than that I am like the grasshopper in the
fable, which I have read of in my lady's book, as follows:--[See the
Aesop's Fables which have lately been selected and reformed from those

future, from every portion of the Queen's Dominions--as of the one
Imperial army;--an Imperial army paid for by the whole Empire.

Why, finally, since he promises the just a never-ending bliss after
death, or, in other words, gives us the idea and desire of happiness,
does he not cause us to enjoy this life by stripping us of the
temptation of evil, instead of exposing us to an eternity of torture?

"Why, sir, it's none o' my inventing, and I should never ha' thought
of it; for my husband, as ought to know about the law, he allays used
to say as lawyers had never no call to buy anything,--either lands or
houses,--for they allays got 'em into their hands other ways."

Why, when there was a tempest in her soul, and she felt she was
standing at a turning point in her life, which might have fearful
consequences--why, at that minute, she had to keep up appearances
before an outsider, who sooner or later must know it all--she did not
know.

Why," replied Athos, carelessly, "she is probably going to write to
the cardinal that a damned Musketeer, named Athos, has taken her safe-
conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter to
get rid of his two friends, Aramis and Porthos, at the same time.

Why there had been any fight at all at Santa Lucia, where nothing was
to be gained, much to be lost, he was incapable of telling; but
attributed it to an antique chivalry on the part of the king, that had
prompted the hero to a trial of strength, a bout of blood- letting.

Why will he not continue to mix with the world smoothly, appeased by
the flattery of her secret and really sincere preference of him, and
taking his revenge in satire of it, as she does from her own not very
lofty standard, and will by and by do from his more exalted one?

Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but
now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a
smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had
walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself.

"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."

Why is it not seen that these ideas are mutually repellent, and that,
if, by some impossibility, the proletaire could reach a certain degree
of intelligence, he would make use of it in the first place to
revolutionize society and change all civil and industrial relations?

"Why, sir, before Lady Ellinor set out she was afraid that there might
be something in the papers to alarm Miss Fanny, and so she sent Henry
down to Lady Castleton's to beg her ladyship to make as light of it as
she could; but it seems that Henry blabbed the worst to Mrs."

Why, for instance, should the colour of a flower be more likely to
vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species, supposed to
have been created independently, have differently coloured flowers,
than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured flowers?

Why should an auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago, who had as
good as forgotten his free-school Latin, be expected to manifest a
delicate scrupulosity which is not always exhibited by gentlemen of
the learned professions, even in our present advanced stage of
morality?

Why, there's a ballad that says they put King Rodrigo alive into a
tomb full of toads, and adders, and lizards, and that two days
afterwards the king, in a plaintive, feeble voice, cried out from
within the tomb- They gnaw me now, they gnaw me now, There where I
most did sin.

Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style; A style for challengers:
why, she defies me, Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain Could
not drop forth such giant-rude invention, Such Ethiop words, blacker
in their effect Than in their countenance.--Will you hear the letter?

`Why,' said he, `does not the emperor, who has devised so many clever
and efficient modes of improving the art of war, organize a regiment
of lawyers, judges and legal practitioners, sending them in the
hottest fire the enemy could maintain, and using them to save better
men?

Why weavers, gardeners, and gladiators--or a man with a pined leg
(proceeding from some ailment in the foot)--should ever have had some
tender nymph breaking her heart in secret for them, are points well
and duly settled and accounted for, by ancient and modern
physiologists.

Why, then, Theridamas, I'll first assay To get the Persian kingdom to
myself; Then thou for Parthia; they for Scythia and Media; And, if I
prosper, all shall be as sure As if the Turk, the Pope, Afric, and
Greece, Came creeping to us with their crowns a-piece.<112> TECHELLES.

Why, there are hundreds of books like these, each one of which, if
really read, really assimilated, by the person to whom it happens to
appeal, will enable that person quite unconsciously to furnish himself
with much ammunition which he will find of use in the battle of life.

Why, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should
condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions;
though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived
without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon
his track.

Why yfaith me thinks shee's too low for a hie praise, too browne for a
faire praise, and too little for a great praise, onely this
commendation I can affoord her, that were shee other then she is, she
were vnhandsome, and being no other, but as she is, I doe not like her
Clau.

Why, tis a boysterous and a cruell stile, A stile for challengers:
why, she defies me, Like Turke to Christian: womens gentle braine
Could not drop forth such giant rude inuention, Such Ethiop words,
blacker in their effect Then in their countenance: will you heare the
letter?

Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool; only his gift is in
devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in him; and
the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany; for he both
pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him.

Why man hee s a verie diuell, I haue not seen such a firago: I had a
passe with him, rapier, scabberd, and all: and he giues me the stucke
in with such a mortall motion that it is ineuitable: and on the
answer, he payes you as surely, as your feete hits the ground they
step on.

Why 'tis no great matter: for a very little theefe of Occasion, will
rob you of a great deale of Patience: Giue your dispositions the
reines, and bee angry at your pleasures (at the least) if you take it
as a pleasure to you, in being so: you blame Martius for being proud
Brut.

Why ther's the priuiledge your beauty beares: Fie trecherous hue, that
will betray with blushing The close enacts and counsels of the hart:
Heer's a young Lad fram'd of another leere, Looke how the blacke slaue
smiles vpon the father; As who should say, old Lad I am thine owne.

Why, right; you are i' the right; And so, without more circumstance at
all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part: You, as your business
and desires shall point you,-- For every man hath business and desire,
Such as it is;--and for my own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray.

Why it should be unlikely that a people confessedly familiar with
writing used it for the preservation of literature, when we know that
even the Red Indians preserve their songs by means of pictographs,
while West African tribes use incised characters, is certainly not
obvious.

Why, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words `of a citizen,'
you will not be far wrong;--hereafter, if you like, we will carry the
examination further, but at present we are we w seeking not for
courage but justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said
enough.

Why, I was obliged to let him understand explicitly that I preferred
to keep _some_ of my clothes for my own personal wearing; also, I put
his magnificence upon an allowance of cologne-water, and actually was
so cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs.

Why the terms FREE INHABITANTS are used in one part of the article,
FREE CITIZENS in another, and PEOPLE in another; or what was meant by
superadding to ``all privileges and immunities of free citizens,''
``all the privileges of trade and commerce,'' cannot easily be
determined.

Why, he'll say, 'It's a great pity, but my church matters has got to
get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the
dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's my bounden duty to set down
here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she's got
it.

Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem---" Tess's sense of a certain
ludicrousness in her errand was now so strong that, notwithstanding
her awe of him, and her general discomfort at being here, her rosy
lips curved towards a smile, much to the attraction of the swarthy
Alexander.

'Why, in the first place:--but you're no lawyer, warden, and I doubt
you won't understand it; the gist of the matter is this:--under
Hiram's will two paid guardians have been selected for the hospital;
the law will say two paid servants, and you and I won't quarrel with
the name.

"Why, it matters this much, mistress," says the lawyer, deliberately
putting away his handkerchief and adjusting his frill; "the law is so
despotic here that it interferes to prevent any of our good English
citizens from being troubled, even by a lady's visits against his
desire."

"Why, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head,
with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my
pocket, without reckoning what was there before -- making in all about
two hundred francs, -- why, I should certainly be arrested at the
barriers."

Why has not the legislator fixed the conditions differently?--why,
instead of twenty and thirty years, is not a single year sufficient to
prescribe?--why are not voluntary absence and confessed idleness as
good grounds for dispossession as involuntary absence, ignorance, or
apathy?

Why right, you are i'th' right; And so, without more circumstance at
all, I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part: You, as your busines
and desires shall point you: For euery man ha's businesse and desire,
Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part, Looke you, Ile goe pray
Hor.

"Why, then, Squills," said my father, familiarly, "you son would know
that though a scholar is often a fool, he is never a fool so supreme,
so superlative, as when he is defacing the first unsullied page of the
human history by entering into it the commonplaces of his own
pedantry."

'Why,' replied his sister with an air of triumph, 'hasn't there been
somebody always coming in and out of this office for the last three or
four weeks; hasn't that somebody been left alone in it sometimes--
thanks to you; and do you mean to tell me that that somebody isn't the
thief!

Why, I'll tell you what, sir,' said Tim, standing in his favourite
attitude and pointing to the cage with the feather of his pen, 'it's a
very extraordinary thing about that bird, that the only people he ever
takes the smallest notice of, are Mr Charles, and Mr Ned, and you, and
me.

Why, it was just his Lordship himself who started the outcry about the
window, by proving that it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of
Guermantes and a direct descendant of Geneviève de Brabant, who was a
daughter of the House of Guermantes, receiving absolution from Saint
Hilaire.

Why am I, who am so sensible of the modest generosity of this
bookseller, so little so of the noisy eagerness of many persons of the
highest rank, who pompously fill the world with accounts of the
services they say they wished to render me, but the good effects of
which I never felt?

"Why, these apes are so cunning," returned Pencroft; "they won't show
themselves again at the windows and so we can't kill them; and when I
think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse--" "Have
patience," replied Harding; "these creatures cannot keep us long at
bay."

Why, dear sir, said I, you have seen the poor fellow's penitence in my
letters.--Yes, my dear, so I have; but that is his penitence for his
having served me against you; and, I think, when he would have
betrayed me afterwards, he deserves nothing to be said or done for him
by either.

Why, says he, in the sea-service, it is impossible to do any thing
without them, there being not more than three men of the whole King's
side that are fit to command almost; and these were Captain Allen,
Smith, and Beech; and it may be Holmes, and Utber, and Batts might do
something.

Why, sudden as a flash of lightning, it seemed, the news came over the
wire to the Mariposa Newspacket, that they had struck a vein of silver
in the Northern Star as thick as a sidewalk, and that the stock had
jumped to seventeen dollars a share, and even at that you couldn't get
it!

Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so small a wolf that I
could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked
you away dead (as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times, when I see you
loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you hadn't found no
uncles then.

"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard
and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering
like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he
fetched you another awful clip--and here you've laid, as dead as a
wedge til now."

Why, this woman can tell us what the world was like before what is
called 'the Flood'; can give us the origin of that vast astounding
myth; can set the mind back to the consideration of things which to us
now seem primeval, but which were old stories before the days of the
Patriarchs.

Why that's E. F.'s he was the greatest farmer in these parts, another
of the aristocracy, had a most a noble stock o' cattle, and the matter
of some hundreds out in jint notes; well he took the contract for beef
with the troops; and he fell astarn so, I guess its a gone goose with
him.

Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare
mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,
speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
with new-fallen snow?

Why so anxious to inform us of the great company which you have kept;
the obliging things which were said to you; the honours, the
distinctions which you met with; as if these were not things of
course, and what we could readily, of ourselves, have imagined,
without being told of them?

Why I did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in
spite of all; you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely
when you saw the situation; you did not remain at my pleasure; so
there was one petticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt, and
you are she.

Why should he lead us from love of ourselves to the sublime emotions
which the discovery of his wisdom and goodness excites, if these
feelings were not set in motion to improve our nature, of which they
make a part, and render us capable of enjoying a more godlike portion
of happiness?

Why should they not take away the child from the mother, select the
nurse, regulate the school, overlook the playground, fix the hours of
labour and of recreation, prescribe what ballads shall be sung, what
tunes shall be played, what books shall be read, what physic shall be
swallowed?

Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch
of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of
sack, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that
reverend Vice, that grey Iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
years?

Why, Sir, the gentleman from Coles, the mover of this resolution, very
lately denied on this floor that the Legislature had any right to
repeal or otherwise meddle with its own acts, when those acts were
made in the nature of contracts, and had been accepted and acted on by
other parties.

Why, we could, if we pleased, lie by and pass two or three decades as
jolly cricketers and scullers, and resume the race for wealth with the
rest of mankind, hardly sensible of the holiday in our pockets though
we were the last people to do it, we were the sole people that had the
option.

Why, guardian," I explained, not without reddening a little at
hazarding what was in my thoughts, "there is something so tender in
his manner, after all, and he is so very courtly and gentle to us, and
--" Mr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have
just described him.

Why then resort to arguments which, while they could add nothing to
the strength of the case, considered in a legal point of view, tended
to aggravate the moral guilt of the fatal enterprise, and to excite
fear and resentment in that quarter from which alone the Earl could
now expect mercy?

Why then dost thou too choose to act in the same way; and why dost
thou not leave these agitations which are foreign to nature to those
who cause them and those who are moved by them; and why art thou not
altogether intent upon the right way of making use of the things which
happen to thee?

Why a spirit was to be evoked for the purpose of talking over such
matters and seeing such sights, why the vicar of the parish, a blue-
stocking from London, or an American, such as Mr. Southey at first
supposed the aerial visitor to be, might not have done as well, we are
unable to conceive.

Why, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you, that
you will never let any one know that it was I who supplied them; for
the persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if
they only laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to
pieces like glass.

Why, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that
continually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly
conscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even
an embittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and
amusing myself by it.

Why, now, and please your honour, said I, (for I was quite courageous
just then,) you could not have asked me this question, if you had not
taken from me my letter to my father and mother, in which I own I had
broken my mind freely to them, and asked their advice, and poured
forth my griefs!

Why should Europe get into such a turmoil over this petty Sultan and
his old Pasha, if it is only a question whether we or the English
shall civilize the Orient,--shall instruct Egypt and Syria in the
European arts, and shall teach them to construct machines, dig canals,
and build railroads?

Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich
lading wrack'd on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the
place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a
tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest
woman of her word.

Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for
as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over
it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her
on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of
her stockings.

'Why, there's Copperfield, mother,' he angrily retorted, pointing his
lean finger at me, against whom all his animosity was levelled, as the
prime mover in the discovery; and I did not undeceive him; 'there's
Copperfield, would have given you a hundred pound to say less than
you've blurted out!

Why did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been
sure he could never feel again--that sense of the beauty of land and
sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at
drawing, nearer to the great old house which had held those of his
blood for six hundred years?

"Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made
me promise several times never to speak of that letter to any one,
assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this,
he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name
mentioned in the address."

Why, I only mean that if it was me, I wouldn't keep papers as might
hang me, littering about when they might be turned into money--them as
wasn't useful made away with, and them as was, laid by somewheres,
safe; that's all,' returned Squeers; 'but everybody's the best judge
of their own affairs.

Why, this used to be one of the old Cesnola rooms," he heard some one
say; and instantly everything about him vanished, and he was sitting
alone on a hard leather divan against a radiator, while a slight
figure in a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrely- fitted
vista of the old Museum.

Why, then, truly I think on no other way at present but blending the
two into one; and, from this marriage of huffing and cringing, there
will result a new kind of careless medley, which, perhaps, will work
upon both sorts of readers, those who are to be hectored, and those
whom we must creep to.

'Why, ma'am,' he returned, 'I am thinking about Tom Gradgrind's whim;'
Tom Gradgrind, for a bluff independent manner of speaking - as if
somebody were always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums to
say Thomas, and he wouldn't; 'Tom Gradgrind's whim, ma'am, of bringing
up the tumbling-girl.

Why will they never understand that fraternity can be established only
by justice; that justice alone, the condition, means, and law of
liberty and fraternity, must be the object of our study; and that its
determination and formula must be pursued without relaxation, even to
the minutest details?

Why certain bright colours should excite pleasure cannot, I presume,
be explained, any more than why certain flavours and scents are
agreeable; but habit has something to do with the result, for that
which is at first unpleasant to our senses, ultimately becomes
pleasant, and habits are inherited.

Why, Pamela, said he, a little seriously, why this behaviour, for my
goodness to you in the garden?--This is not of a piece with your
conduct and softness there, that quite charmed me in your favour: And
you must not give me cause to think that you will be the more
insolent, as you find me kinder.

Why, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or
animal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or
soil, in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the
want of a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is
good than what is not.

Why, of course, so unprepared as I was, without a stick of furniture,
and hardly a shilling, I shouldn't have hurried on our affair, and
brought you to a half-furnished hut before I was ready, if it had not
been for the news you gave me, which made it necessary to save you,
ready or no.... Good God!

Why do you come, then," she burst out, "talking and interfering with
us and scolding us, if you don't mean to do anything to help my poor
mother--your own sister,--if you've no feeling for her when she's in
trouble, and won't part with anything, though you would never miss it,
to save her from pain?

Why, only last term, just before I was rusticated, that is, I mean
just before I had the measles, ha, ha--there was me and Ringwood of
Christchurch, Bob Ringwood, Lord Cinqbars' son, having our beer at the
Bell at Blenheim, when the Banbury bargeman offered to fight either of
us for a bowl of punch.

Why yet it liues there vncheckt, that Anthonio hath a ship of rich
lading wrackt on the narrow Seas; the Goodwins I thinke they call the
place, a very dangerous flat, and fatall, where the carcasses of many
a tall ship, lye buried, as they say, if my gossips report be an
honest woman of her word Sol.

Why should I bind another, by a deed or promise, to do me any good
office, when I know that he is already prompted, by the strongest
inclination, to seek my happiness, and would, of himself, perform the
desired service; except the hurt, he thereby receives, be greater than
the benefit accruing to me?

Why that's my dainty Ariell: I shall misse Thee, but yet thou shalt
haue freedome: so, so, so, To the Kings ship, inuisible as thou art,
There shalt thou finde the Marriners asleepe Vnder the Hatches: the
Master and the Boat-swaine Being awake, enforce them to this place;
And presently, I pre'thee Ar.

Why exactly many savages have made it a rule to refrain from women in
time of war, we cannot say for certain, but we may conjecture that
their motive was a superstitious fear lest, on the principles of
sympathetic magic, close contact with women should infect them with
feminine weakness and cowardice.

"Why," said Tom, coloring, but trying to speak firmly, in spite of a
boyish tremor, "I remember quite well, before I went to school to Mr.
Stelling, my father said to me one night, when we were sitting by the
fire together, and no one else was in the room----" Tom hesitated a
little, and then went on.

Why do not people see that liberty bears the burdens of privilege, and
that, if, by some impossibility, all industries were to be treated
like the tobacco industry, the source of subsidies failing, the nation
could no longer balance its receipts and its expenses, and the State
would become a bankrupt?

Why, you see, there is a difference in the names `discord' and `war,'
and I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the
one is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what
is external and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord,
and only the second, war.

Why, sir, said I, her ladyship went on in the same manner; but said,
one time, (and held me by the hand,) she would give me an hundred
guineas for one provoking word; or, if I would but say I believed
myself married, that she might fell me at her foot: But, sir, you must
not be angry with her ladyship.

Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means
of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same
thing ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through
civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less
bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare.

Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By
what it fed on: and yet, within a month,-- Let me not think on't,--
Frailty, thy name is woman!-- A little month; or ere those shoes were
old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all
tears;--why she, even she,-- O God!

"Why, now the mill and the land's all Wakem's, and he's got everything
in his hands, what's the use o' setting your face against him, when he
says you may stay here, and speaks as fair as can be, and says you may
manage the business, and have thirty shillings a-week, and a horse to
ride about to market?"

Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars;
set at upper end o' the table: no question asked him by any of the
senators but they stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him, sanctifies himself with's hand, and turns up the
white o' the eye to his discourse.

Why, the workmen at his house were nigh pitching the contractors all
sprawling on a strike, and Mr. Radnor takes train, harangues 'em and
rubs 'em smooth; ten minutes by the clock, they say; and return train
to his business in town; by reason of good sense and feeling, it was;
poor men don't ask for more.

Why, you know, sir,' returned Brass, venturing to be more familiar: '
--the fact is, sir, that any allusion to these little combinings
together, of friends, for objects in themselves extremely laudable,
but which the law terms conspiracies, are--you take me, sir?--best
kept snug and among friends, you know.

Why, I've seen drops myself ordered by Doctor Gambit, as is our club
doctor and a good charikter, and has brought more live children into
the world nor ever another i' Middlemarch--I say I've seen drops
myself as made no difference whether they was in the glass or out, and
yet have griped you the next day.

Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state of mind in which
I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting
her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which I now
reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty, and
the returned transport whom I harbored?

Why should there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which..."
"When electricity was discovered," Levin interrupted hurriedly, "it
was only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from
what it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before
its applications were conceived.

Why, truly, for a pair of diamond ear-rings, a necklace, and a diamond
ring for my finger; which would not become me: For a few paltry fine
clothes, which, when I wore them, would make but my former poverty
more ridiculous to every body that saw me; especially when they knew
the base terms I wore them upon.

Why this it is: See, see, I haue beene begging sixteene yeares in
Court (Am yet a Courtier beggerly) nor could Come pat betwixt too
early, and too late For any suit of pounds: and you, (oh fate) A very
fresh Fish heere; fye, fye, fye vpon This compel'd fortune: haue your
mouth fild vp, Before you open it An.

Why, 'tis a plain case: he that went like a bass-viol in a case of
leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a
sob, and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and
gives them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more
exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.

Why, O Lord, dost Thou pass by most holy persons, who have always
served Thee, and who have been tried; who have been brought up in
religion, and are really religious--not such as I am, having only the
name--so as to make it plain that they are not recipients of those
graces which Thou hast bestowed upon me?

Why, for instance, should the following caution be given, when art of
every kind must contaminate the mind; and why entangle the grand
motives of action, which reason and religion equally combine to
enforce, with pitiful worldly shifts and slight of hand tricks to gain
the applause of gaping tasteless fools?

Why, what would you do, said I, if you were he?--Not stand
shill-I-shall-I, as he does; but put you and himself both out of your
pain.--Why, Jezebel, said I, (I could not help it,) would you ruin me
by force?--Upon this she gave me a deadly slap upon my shoulder: Take
that, said she; whom do you call Jezebel?

Why 'tis well known, that whiles I was Protector, Pittie was all the
fault that was in me: For I should melt at an Offendors teares, And
lowly words were Ransome for their fault: Vnlesse it were a bloody
Murtherer, Or foule felonious Theefe, that fleec'd poore passengers, I
neuer gaue them condigne punishment.

Why me, in whom till now you showed the most entire confidence - who
for thirty years have been attached to your person, and have given you
a thousand proofs of my devotion - for it must be said, now that I am
accused - why reduce me to see three thousand of the king's soldiers
march in battle against two men?

Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally
owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales;
for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they
soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him
down into a peculiarly valuable oil.

Why, look, that great space that seems to open out in the half-dark of
the falling evening,--why, surely yes,--Lake Ossawippi, the big lake,
as they used to call it, from which the river runs down to the smaller
lake,--Lake Wissanotti,--where the town of Mariposa has lain waiting
for you there for thirty years.

Why had John Eames, at the very moment when he should have been doing
his best to drive from her breast the memory of past follies--when he
would have striven to do so had he really been earnest in his suit--
why at such a moment had he allowed himself to correspond in terms of
affection with such a woman as M D?

Why, let the strucken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For some
must watch, while some must sleep: So runs the world away.-- Would not
this, sir, and a forest of feathers--if the rest of my fortunes turn
Turk with me,--with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?

Why do not the economists, if they believe, as they appear to, that
the labor of each should leave an excess, use all their influence in
spreading this truth, so simple and so luminous: Each man's labor can
buy only the value which it contains, and this value is proportional
to the services of all other laborers?

Why then, Pamela, said he, suppose I find a man of probity, and
genteel calling, for a husband for you, that shall make you a
gentlewoman as long as you live?--I want no husband, sir, said I: for
now I began to see him in all his black colours!--Yet being so much in
his power, I thought I would a little dissemble.

Why, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of
a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you
fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it
were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and
children `friends have all things in common.

Why might not"--(he added, laughing, for it was part of his manner to
keep much of his discourse apparently betwixt jest and earnest)--"why
might not Cardinal Osbaldistone have swayed the fortunes of empires,
well-born and well-connected, as well as the low-born Mazarin, or
Alberoni, the son of an Italian gardener?

"Why, it would be delightful, Willoughby, but it happens I've got a
lot of powder I want to let off, and so I've an idea of shouldering my
gun along the sea-coast and shooting gulls: which'll be a harmless
form of committing patricide and matricide and fratricide--for there's
my family, and I come of it!--the gull!"

'Why, I suppose they can't do much to me, if I explain how it was that
I got into the good company of that there ca-daverous old Slider,'
replied Squeers viciously, 'who I wish was dead and buried, and
resurrected and dissected, and hung upon wires in a anatomical museum,
before ever I'd had anything to do with her.

Why, then, do they not see that money is the written law of commerce,
the type of exchange, the first link in that long chain of creations
all of which, as merchandise, must receive the sanction of society,
and become, if not in fact, at least in right, acceptable as money in
settlement of all kinds of transactions?

Why, this is not a boon; 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your
gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you
to do a peculiar profit To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed, It shall be full of poise
and difficult weight, And fearful to be granted.

"Why, in that way, for instance," his uncle had answered, pointing to
Akim's beard, which he had begun to clip in order to please his
betrothed, though he had refused to shave it completely.... Akim
looked down; while the old man turned away, wrapped his tattered
sheepskin about him and walked away, shaking his head.

Why Englishmen, who are so notoriously fond of good living, should be
so helplessly incompetent in the art of cookery, is one of the great
mysteries of nature; but from the varied abominations of the railway
refreshment-rooms to the monotonous dinners of the poor, English
feeding is either wasteful or nasty, or both.

Why should not the same principle be applied to acts of
insubordination, cowardice, or other misconduct on the part of masters
and mariners producing injury or death to passengers on the high seas,
beyond the jurisdiction of any of the States, and where such
delinquencies can be reached only by the power of Congress?

Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing you make of me: you would play
vpon mee; you would seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the
heart of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest Note, to the
top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke, excellent Voice, in
this little Organe, yet cannot you make it.

Why she had chosen Paulo Neroni, a man of no birth and no property, a
mere captain in the pope's guard, one who had come up to Milan either
simply as an adventurer or as a spy, a man of harsh temper and oily
manners, mean in figure, swarthy in face, and so false in words as to
be hourly detected, need not now be told.

Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed To thy
transgressions, and disturbed the charge Of others, who approve not to
transgress By thy example, but have power and right To question thy
bold entrance on this place; Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and
those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!

Why should I, (answered Beauty,) it would be very needless, for my
father shall not suffer upon my account, since the monster will accept
of one of his daughters, I will deliver myself up to all his fury, and
I am very happy in thinking that my death will save my father's life,
and be a proof of my tender love for him.

Why, this same Supreme Court once decided a national bank to be
constitutional; but General Jackson, as President of the United
States, disregarded the decision, and vetoed a bill for a recharter,
partly on constitutional ground, declaring that each public
functionary must support the Constitution "as he understands it.

Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from thee: yet, for
the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange; therefore discase
thee instantly,--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and change
garments with this gentleman: though the pennyworth on his side be the
worst, yet hold thee, there's some boot.

Why, I'll tell you now, in good faith, and by this chair, which, by
the grace of God, I intend presently to sit in, I had three suits in
one year made three great ladies in love with me: I had other three,
undid three gentlemen in imitation: and other three gat three other
gentlemen widows of three thousand pound a year.

Why doctor she: my Lord, there's one arriu'd, If you will see her: now
by my faith and honour, If seriously I may conuay my thoughts In this
my light deliuerance, I haue spoke With one, that in her sexe, her
yeeres, profession, Wisedome and constancy, hath amaz'd mee more Then
I dare blame my weakenesse: will you see her?

----"Why, it is," answered the wife, "that she is too humble to be any
very great lady: for, while our Betty was warming the bed, she called
her nothing but child, and my dear, and sweetheart; and, when Betty
offered to pull off her shoes and stockings, she would not suffer her,
saying, she would not give her the trouble.

Why should we venture on the assertion that if adopted by the writers
of the Old Testament it would make them guilty of falsehood?...There
is nothing that need startle us in the thought that an inspired writer
might use a liberty which has been granted without hesitation to the
teachers of mankind in every age and country.

Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of
either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior
with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear
the offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the
flock is to be maintained in first-rate condition.

Why should you 'take on' as if you weren't a perfect dear yourself,
capable of all the sweetest things?--as if you hadn't in fact grown up
in an atmosphere, the atmosphere of all the good things that I
recognised, even of old, as soon as I came near you, and that you've
allowed me now, between you, to make so blessedly my own.

Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more
earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and expecting God to favor
their side: for one of our soldiers who had been taken prisoner told
Senator Wilson a few days since that he met nothing so discouraging as
the evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers.

Why the connection terminated has never been exactly known; but it is
certain that Lord Shelburne behaved with the utmost consideration and
kindness towards Priestley; that he fulfilled his engagements to the
letter; and that, at a later period, he expressed a desire that
Priestley should return to his old footing in his house.

Why, then you see the insurgent Saxon seamen (of the names in two
syllables with accent on the first), and their Danish captains, and it
may be but a remnant of high- nosed old Norman Lord de Warenne beside
them, in the criminal box: and presently the Jew smoking a giant
regalia cigar on a balcony giving view of a gallows-tree.

Why, the Valley itself, which is as dark as pitch; we also saw there
the hobgoblins, satyrs, and dragons of the pit; we heard also in that
Valley a continual howling and yelling, as of a people under
unutterable misery, who there sat bound in affliction and irons; and
over that Valley hangs the discouraging clouds of confusion.

Why, gentlemen, I think you are as gallant and as brave men as live;
that you can fight as bravely in a good cause, man for man, as any
other people living; that you have shown yourselves capable of this
upon various occasions: but, man for man, you are not better than we
are, and there are not so many of you as there are of us.

Why, says Daniel, let me see, I have to go down south to Washington,
to plead the great Insurance case of the Hartford Company--and I've
got to be at Cincinnati to attend the Convention, and I don't see how
I can go to Rhode Island without great loss and great fatigue; it
would cost you may be more than you'd be willing to give.

Why, the Ecclesiastical Delegates were the advocates without any
business, who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in
both courts, and had seen the cards shuffled, and cut, and played, and
had talked to all the players about it, and now came fresh, as judges,
to settle the matter to the satisfaction of everybody!

Why, we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that
different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never
considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of
nature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different
pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures.

Why, supposing I had a knowledge of some property--some little
property--very little--to which this pretty chick was entitled; which
nobody does or can know of at this time, but which her husband could
sweep into his pouch, if he knew as much as I do, would that account
for--' 'For the whole proceeding,' rejoined Ralph, abruptly.

Why, so is the earth to the sowing husbandman, and though we cannot
forecast a reaping season, we have in history durable testification
that our seasons come in the souls of men, yea, as a planet that we
have set in motion, and faster and faster are we spinning it, and
firmer and firmer shall we set it to regularity of revolution.

Why, be so still: here's no body will steale that from thee: yet for
the out-side of thy pouertie, we must make an exchange; therefore dis-
case thee instantly (thou must thinke there's a necessitie in't) and
change Garments with this Gentleman: Though the penny-worth (on his
side) be the worst, yet hold thee, there's some boot Aut.

Why should we in the compass of a pale Keep law and form and due
proportion, Showing, as in a model, our firm estate, When our sea-
walled garden, the whole land, Is full of weeds; her fairest flowers
chok'd up, Her fruit trees all unprun'd, her hedges ruin'd, Her knots
disordered, and her wholesome herbs Swarming with caterpillars?

Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply: Be as ourself in Denmark.--Madam,
come; This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my
heart: in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell; And the king's rouse
the heaven shall bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder.

'Why,' replied the youth, drawing closer to his questioner's side, 'I
was with him at night, and when it was all silent he cried no more for
friends he wished to come and sit with him, but began to see faces
round his bed that came from home; he said they smiled, and talked to
him; and he died at last lifting his head to kiss them.

Why the males subsequently lost their horns, we know not; but this may
have been caused through the principle of compensation, owing to the
development of the large horns and projections on the lower surface;
and as these are confined to the males, the rudiments of the upper
horns on the females would not have been thus obliterated.

Why should not the State have an armory for the repair of arms, for
the alteration of old models so as to make them conform to the
improved weapons of the present day, and for the manufacture on a
limited scale of new arms, including cannon and their carriages; the
casting of shot and shells, and the preparation of fixed ammunition?

Why, our battalia trebles that account: Besides, the king's name is a
tower of strength, Which they upon the adverse faction want.-- Up with
the tent!--Come, noble gentlemen, Let us survey the vantage of the
ground;-- Call for some men of sound direction:-- Let's lack no
discipline, make no delay; For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

--"Why, I must confess," says Square, "as the matter was
misrepresented to me, by that parson Thwackum, I might condemn the
corruption of innocence: it was that, sir, it was that--and that--:
for you must know, Mr Jones, in the consideration of fitness, very
minute circumstances, sir, very minute circumstances cause great
alteration.

Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for Sallie's party, so she just
painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever
saw, and they looked exactly like satin," added Jo, with an air of
pride in her sister's accomplishments that exasperated Amy till she
felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her.

Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate; I had my fathers Signet in my
Purse, Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale: Folded the Writ vp
in forme of the other, Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it
safely, The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day Was our Sea
Fight, and what to this was sement, Thou know'st already Hor.

Why, the aspect and form of the men when seen are these," said the
hunter: "they have the colour of the raven on their hair, their skin
like swan on the wave in whiteness, and their cheeks as the blood of
the brindled red calf, and their speed and their leap are those of the
salmon of the torrent and the deer of the grey mountain side.

Why, then you may rouse my indignation or wound my pride,' rejoined
Nicholas; 'but you will not break my rest; for if the scene were acted
over again, I could take no other part than I have taken; and whatever
consequences may accrue to myself from it, I shall never regret doing
as I have done--never, if I starve or beg in consequence.

Why, sir, both he and Goody Andrews, after they had conferred together
upon your letter, madam, came out, weeping bitterly, that grieved my
very heart; and they said, Now all was over with their poor daughter;
and either she had written that letter by compulsion, or had yielded
to your honour; so they said; and was, or would be ruined!

Why thou horson impudent imbost Rascall, if there were any thing in
thy Pocket but Tauerne Recknings, Memorandums of Bawdie-houses, and
one poore peny-worth of Sugar-candie to make thee long-winded: if thy
pocket were enrich'd with anie other iniuries but these, I am a
Villaine: And yet you will stand to it, you will not Pocket vp wrong.

Why then to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn; On Tuesday noon, or night;
on Wednesday morn:-- I pr'ythee, name the time; but let it not Exceed
three days: in faith, he's penitent; And yet his trespass, in our
common reason,-- Save that, they say, the wars must make examples Out
of their best,--is not almost a fault To incur a private check.

Why-- since she's going back to Europe so soon; since Granny approves
and understands, and has arranged to make her independent of her
husband--" She broke off, and Archer, grasping the corner of the
mantelpiece in one convulsed hand, and steadying himself against it,
made a vain effort to extend the same control to his reeling thoughts.

Why that were couetousnesse: Siluius; the time was, that I hated thee;
And yet it is not, that I beare thee loue, But since that thou canst
talke of loue so well, Thy company, which erst was irkesome to me I
will endure; and Ile employ thee too: But doe not looke for further
recompence Then thine owne gladnesse, that thou art employd Sil.

Why, if I wanted him to dine with me, I used to post him a letter at
the beginning of the week, and then the day before send him a telegram
and a phone-call on the day itself, and--half an hour before the time
we'd fixed--a messenger in a taxi, whose business it was to see that
he got in and that the chauffeur had the address all correct.

Why, how often do men of family and fortune, who haven't your excuse,
but have all the means and superfluities of life within their reach,
how often do they marry their daughters to old men, or (worse still)
to young men without heads or hearts, to tickle some idle vanity,
strengthen some family interest, or secure some seat in Parliament!

Why, this is cheerful news: friends go and come: Reverend Erasmus, who
delicious words Express the very soul and life of wit, Newly took sad
leave of me, and with tears Troubled the silver channel of the Thames,
Which, glad of such a burden, proudly swelled And on her bosom bore
him toward the sea: He's gone to Rotterdam; peace go with him!

"Why, he was not altogether forsaken," continued Caderousse, "for
Mercedes the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him; but
somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for Fernand
-- the very person," added Caderousse with a bitter smile, "that you
named just now as being one of Dantes' faithful and attached friends."

Why, when the great body of mankind had become familiar with this
great discovery-- when they learned that a new source was opened to
them of influence and enjoyment--is it wonderful that from that hour
the heart of nations has palpitated with the desire of becoming
acquainted with all that has happened, and with speculating on what
may occur?

Why the fact is,' said Crowl, who had been listening at Newman's door
with all his might and main; 'the fact is, that they have been talking
so loud, that they quite disturbed me in my room, and so I couldn't
help catching a word here, and a word there; and all I heard,
certainly seemed to refer to their having bolted from some place or
other.

Why that, lambkin, will be pretty!--Then, said the wicked one, you'll
have all the talk to yourself!--Then how will the tongue of the pretty
lambkin bleat out innocence, and virtue, and honesty, till the whole
trial be at an end!--You're a wicked woman, that's certain, said I;
and if you thought any thing of another world, could not talk thus.

Why the very sight of the Yankee galls is good for sore eyes, the dear
little critters, they do look so scrumptious, I tell you, with their
cheeks bloomin like a red rose budded on a white one and their eyes
like Mrs. Adams's diamonds, (that folks say shine as well in the dark
as in the light,) neck like a swan, lips chock full of kisses--lick!

Why he is the Princes ieaster, a very dull foole, onely his gift is,
in deuising impossible slanders, none but Libertines delight in him,
and the commendation is not in his witte, but in his villanie, for hee
both pleaseth men and angers them, and then they laugh at him, and
beat him: I am sure he is in the Fleet, I would he had boorded me
Bene.

Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as
she proud-minded; And where two raging fires meet together, They do
consume the thing that feeds their fury: Though little fire grows
great with little wind, Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;
So I to her, and so she yields to me; For I am rough and woo not like
a babe.

Why, the fact is that continentals generally give us but little alarm;
the liberty which they enjoy will long prevent their taking
precautions against us; it is rather islanders like yourselves,
outside our empire, and subjects smarting under the yoke, who would be
the most likely to take a rash step and lead themselves and us into
obvious danger.

Why, as you are not able to cope with the United States in Canada,
where you have a large army, and where you can join your forces to
those of the Canadians, you should send an expedition and attack the
people of the United States in their own homes and in the centre of
their own resources, where they can bring a larger force to repel our
invasion.

Why, I ask myself, do I see much that I can easily admire in Homer,
Thucydides, Herodotus, Demosthenes, Aristophanes, Theocritus, parts of
Lucretius, Horace's satires and epistles, to say nothing of other
ancient writers, and yet find myself at once repelled by even those
works of AEschylus, Sophocles and Euripides which are most generally
admired.

Why should I not, (had I the heart to do it) Like to th' Egyptian
theefe, at point of death Kill what I loue: (a sauage iealousie, That
sometime sauours nobly) but heare me this: Since you to non-regardance
cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screwes me
from my true place in your fauour: Liue you the Marble-brested Tirant
still.

Why cannot we be buried as eggs in neat little cells with ten or
twenty thousand pounds each wrapped round us in Bank of England notes,
and wake up, as the sphex wasp does, to find that its papa and mamma
have not only left ample provision at its elbow, but have been eaten
by sparrows some weeks before it began to live consciously on its own
account?

Why," broke in Mark, who was a trifle better student than was his
chum, "don't you remember that the moon rotates on its axis once a
month, or in about twenty-eight days, to be exact, and so half of that
time is day and half night, just as on our earth, when it revolves on
its axis in twenty-four hours, half the time is day and half the time
is night.

Why, you foolish young man, don't you see that with his ignorance of
business where he himself is concerned,--though for any other one's
business, neither Rollick nor Cool has a better judgment,-- and with
his d--d Quixotic spirit of honor worked up into a state of
excitement, he would have rushed to Mr. Tibbets and exclaimed, "How
much do we owe you?

Why does he select the lilacs, evening star, and hermit thrush, as the
_motifs_ of the poem, _When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd?_ In
_Patrolling Barnegat_, do you notice any resemblance to Anglo-Saxon
poetry of the sea, _e.g._ to _Beowulf_ or _The Seafarer?_ In _With
Husky-Haughty Lips, O Sea!_ what touches are unlike those of Anglo-
Saxon poets?

Why, when my uncle was informed that you were to be his guest for some
time, and that your father desired to have one of his hopeful sons to
fill up the lucrative situation in his counting-house which was vacant
by your obstinacy, Mr. Francis, the good knight held a _cour
ple'nie're_ of all his family, including the butler, housekeeper, and
gamekeeper.

``Why could not one submit to it,'' the tsar continued, ``the positive
rights of nations, assure the privilege of neutrality, insert the
obligation of never beginning war until all the resources which the
mediation of a third party could offer have been exhausted, having by
this means brought to light the respective grievances, and tried to
remove them?

Why, therefore, should we put Mithridates upon this resource, who as
yet does not see now he may best fight with us, and disdains to stoop
to Tigranes; and not rather allow him time to gather a new army and
grow confident again, that we may thus fight with Colchians, and
Tibarenians, whom we have often defeated already, and not with Medes
and Armenians.

Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners, But with proviso and exception,
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight His brother-in-law,
the foolish Mortimer; Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd The
lives of those that he did lead to fight Against that great magician,
damn'd Glendower, Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March Hath
lately married.

Why provide in the constitution that each shall freely enjoy the fruit
of his labor and industry, when, by the fact or the tendency of the
tax, this permission is granted only to the extent of a dividend of
fifty-six and a half centimes a day,--a thing, it is true, which the
law could not have foreseen, but which would necessarily result from
progression?

Why shouldst thou desire to see me united with a vagabond, a slave,"
she cried out, "one that does not even belong to our nation, but is
the son of a Canaanitish herdsman, a fellow that attempted to violate
the honor of his mistress, and in punishment for this misdemeanor was
thrown into prison, to be liberated thence by Pharaoh for interpreting
his dream?

Why, said he, do you charge me with a conduct to you, that you bring
upon yourself?--Is it not surprising that you should take the liberty
with me, that the dear mother you have named never gave you an example
for to any of her relations?--Was it not sufficient, that I was
insolently taken to task by you in your letters, but my retirements
must be invaded?

Why not here, and perhaps elsewhere, plant deeply and for all time
centres of learning and living, colleges that yearly would send into
the life of the South a few white men and a few black men of broad
culture, catholic tolerance, and trained ability, joining their hands
to other hands, and giving to this squabble of the Races a decent and
dignified peace?

Why yet doth deny his Prisoners, But with Prouiso and Exception, That
we at our owne charge, shall ransome straight His Brother-in-Law, the
foolish Mortimer, Who (in my soule) hath wilfully betraid The liues of
those, that he did leade to Fight, Against the great Magitian, damn'd
Glendower: Whose daughter (as we heare) the Earle of March Hath lately
married.

Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take
with them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the
manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they
will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they
will have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers
and mothers.

Why, 'a stalks up and down like a peacock--a stride and a stand;
ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set
down her reckoning, bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out'; and so there is;
but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show
without knocking.

Why, Mrs. Jewkes, answered I, there can be but one reason given; and
that is, that I am a sad fool!--But, indeed, I am not ungrateful
neither; nor would I put on a foolish affectation: But my heart, at
times, sinks within me; I know not why, except at my own unworthiness,
and because the honour done me is too high for me to support myself
under, as I should do.

Why, the Supposers, the Perhapsers, the Might-Have-Beeners, the Could-
Have- Beeners, the Must-Have-Beeners, the Without-a-Shadow-of-
Doubters, the We-are-Warranted-in-Believingers, and all that funny
crop of solemn architects who have taken a good solid foundation of
five indisputable and unimportant facts and built upon it a
Conjectural Satan thirty miles high.

Why gentlemen, you doe me double wrong, To striue for that which
resteth in my choice: I am no breeching scholler in the schooles, Ile
not be tied to howres, nor pointed times, But learne my Lessons as I
please my selfe, And to cut off all strife: heere sit we downe, Take
you your instrument, play you the whiles, His Lecture will be done ere
you haue tun'd Hort.

Why, to be sure, didn't I know a lady, a widow of a clergyman: he was
a postermost child, and afore his birth that women read nothin' but
Blair's 'Grave' over and over again, from the end to the
beginnin';--that's a serious book!--very hard readin'!--and at four
years of age that child that come of it reelly was the piousest
infant!--he was like a little curate.

Why may not illicit combinations, for purposes of violence, be formed
as well by a majority of a State, especially a small State as by a
majority of a county, or a district of the same State; and if the
authority of the State ought, in the latter case, to protect the local
magistracy, ought not the federal authority, in the former, to support
the State authority?

Why not build a Division force equivalent using technology and
doctrine to provide a "heavy division equivalent" force using far
fewer troops featuring speed, shock, precision fire while avoiding the
manpower costs of dollars that in peacetime include added costs for
recruitment, training, and sustaining and in war have an even greater
added cost computed in blood?

Why, in the first place, I believe there is no probability that either
of them will employ the power I put into their hands to my
disadvantage;--I consider that honesty serves the purposes of this
life:--I know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of
their characters.--In a word, I'm persuaded that they cannot hurt me
without hurting themselves more.

"Why," says he, "I've been tugging ever since harvest, getting out
wheat and hauling it to the river to raise State Bank paper enough to
pay my tax this year and a little school debt I owe; and now, just as
I 've got it, here I open this infernal Extra Register, expecting to
find it full of 'Glorious Democratic Victories' and 'High Comb'd
Cocks,' when, lo and behold!"

Why, the gayest feather in Miss Monflathers's cap, and the brightest
glory of Miss Monflathers's school, was a baronet's daughter--the real
live daughter of a real live baronet--who, by some extraordinary
reversal of the Laws of Nature, was not only plain in features but
dull in intellect, while the poor apprentice had both a ready wit, and
a handsome face and figure.

Why, doctor 'she': my lord, there's one arriv'd, If you will see her,
--now, by my faith and honour, If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke With one that in her sex,
her years, profession, Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more Than
I dare blame my weakness: will you see her,-- For that is her demand,
--and know her business?

Why do writers familiar with economic language forget that superiority
of talents is synonymous with superiority of wants, and that, instead
of expecting more from vigorous than from ordinary personalities,
society should constantly look out that they do not receive more than
they render, when it is already so hard for the mass of mankind to
render all that it receives?

Why after I haue cut the egge i'th' middle and eate vp the meate, the
two Crownes of the egge: when thou clouest thy Crownes i'th' middle,
and gau'st away both parts, thou boar'st thine Asse on thy backe o're
the durt, thou hadst little wit in thy bald crowne, when thou gau'st
thy golden one away; if I speake like my selfe in this, let him be
whipt that first findes it so.

"Why, thus," said Sir Hubert, "let Your Majesty and us here present
put on the robes of seven of the Order of Black Friars, and let Your
Majesty hang a purse of one hundred pounds beneath your gown; then let
us undertake to ride from here to Mansfield Town tomorrow, and,
without I am much mistaken, we will both meet with Robin Hood and dine
with him before the day be passed."

'Why, my dear,' said he, 'I'll confess the whole scheme to you as I
had laid it; I purposed here to ask you something about your estate,
as you see I did, and when you, as I expected you would, had entered
into some account with me of the particulars, I would have made an
excuse to you to have put off our voyage to Ireland for some time, and
to have gone first towards London.

Why does not the man come forward who has to pronounce my doom?” The
guard replied: “He is too grieved for you, and sheds tears.” Then I
called him by his name of Messer Benedetto da Cagli, [1] and cried:
“Come forward, Messer Benedetto, my friend, for now, I am resolved and
in good frame of mind; far greater glory is it for me to die unjustly
than if I had deserved this fate.

Why, you'd have to go to Doctors' Commons with a suit, and you'd have
to go to a court of Common Law with a suit, and you'd have to go to
the House of Lords with a suit, and you'd have to get an Act of
Parliament to enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if it
was a case of very plain sailing), I suppose from a thousand to
fifteen hundred pound,' said Mr. Bounderby.

Why, all his behaviours did make their retire To the court of his eye,
peeping thorough desire; His heart, like an agate, with your print
impress'd, Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd; His
tongue, all impatient to speak and not see, Did stumble with haste in
his eyesight to be; All senses to that sense did make their repair, To
feel only looking on fairest of fair.

Why is it, then, in the face of the self-evident fact that maximum
prosperity can exist only as the result of the determined effort of
each workman to turn out each day his largest possible day's work,
that the great majority of our men are deliberately doing just the
opposite, and that even when the men have the best of intentions their
work is in most cases far from efficient?

Why, I'll tell you freely, my dear Pamela, said she, and I trust to
your discretion to conceal what I say: my master has been often
desiring me to put you upon asking him to let you stay---- Yes, said
I, Mrs. Jervis, let me interrupt you: I will tell you why I could not
think of that: It was not the pride of my heart, but the pride of my
honesty: For what must have been the case?

Why there is it: Come, sing me a bawdy Song, make me merry; I was as
vertuously giuen, as a Gentleman need to be; vertuous enough, swore
little, dic'd not aboue seuen times a weeke, went to a Bawdy-house not
aboue once in a quarter of an houre, payd Money that I borrowed, three
or foure times; liued well, and in good compasse: and now I liue out
of all order, out of compasse Bard.

Why, thou Mars I tell thee, We haue a Power on foote: and I had
purpose Once more to hew thy Target from thy Brawne, Or loose mine
Arme for't: Thou hast beate mee out Twelue seuerall times, and I haue
nightly since Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thy selfe and me: We haue
beene downe together in my sleepe, Vnbuckling Helmes, fisting each
others Throat, And wak'd halfe dead with nothing.

Why, my dear, said he, I was much moved, you may be sure, when I came
to reflect: But, at first, I was so assured of being a successful
tempter, and spoiling her voyage, that I was vexed, and much out of
humour; but when I came to reflect, as I said, I was quite overcome
with this instance of her prudence, her penitence, and her resolution;
and more admired her than I ever had done.

Why I refer to this broad fact, which distinguishes the populations of
all the four seaward Provinces, as much as it does Lower Canada
herself, is, to show the fixity and stability of that population; to
show that they are by birth British-Americans; that they can nearly
all, of every origin, use that proud phrase when they look daily from
their doors, 'This is my own, my native land.

Why did we not express ourselves in a manner exactly the reverse of
this and, instead of accusing the cosmological idea of over stepping
or of falling short of its true aim, possible experience, say that, in
the first case, the empirical conception is always too small for the
idea, and in the second too great, and thus attach the blame of these
contradictions to the empirical regress?

Why, he loves dogs, and hawks, and his wife well; he has a good riding
face, and he can sit a great horse; he will taint a staff well at
tile; when he is mounted he looks like the sign of the George, that's
all I know; save, that instead of a dragon, he will brandish against a
tree, and break his sword as confidently upon the knotty bark, as the
other did upon the scales of the beast.

Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as
gossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have been
traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often
the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the woman, the
wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical philosophy have
failed to explain to our sense of order.

Why, says I, if drinkin water instead of tea is natur, so is eatin
grass accordin to natur; now all flesh is grass, we are told, so you
had better eat that and call it vegetable; like a man I once seed who
fasted on fish on a Friday, and when he had none, whipped a leg o'
mutton into the oven, and took it out fish, says he it's "changed
PLAICE," that's all, and "PLAICE" aint a bad fish.

Why, Sir, your Julius Caesar, who gave the operation a name;--and your
Hermes Trismegistus, who was born so before ever the operation had a
name;--your Scipio Africanus; your Manlius Torquatus; our Edward the
Sixth,--who, had he lived, would have done the same honour to the
hypothesis:--These, and many more who figured high in the annals of
fame,--all came side-way, Sir, into the world.

Why there, there, there, there, a diamond gone cost me two thousand
ducats in Franckford, the curse neuer fell vpon our Nation till now, I
neuer felt it till now, two thousand ducats in that, and other
precious, precious iewels: I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
and the iewels in her eare: would she were hearst at my foote, and the
duckets in her coffin: no newes of them, why so?

Why he had to go he did not know; but after his after-dinner nap he
gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray stallion that
had not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned with the
horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrushka (Denisov's servant who
had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening
that he was applying for leave and was going home.

Why, look'e, young gentleman,' said Toby, 'when a man keeps himself so
very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house
over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it's rather
a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman
(however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards
with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.

Why, he, the man who hides behind that hideous mask of death!...The
evil genius of the churchyard at Perros!...Red Death!...In a word,
madam, your friend... your Angel of Music!...But I shall snatch off
his mask, as I shall snatch off my own; and, this time, we shall look
each other in the face, he and I, with no veil and no lies between us;
and I shall know whom you love and who loves you!

Why," said he, "if these bills are not paid, the Glasgow merchant
comes on the Hieland lairds, whae hae deil a boddle o' siller, and
will like ill to spew up what is item a' spent--They will turn
desperate--five hundred will rise that might hae sitten at hame--the
deil will gae ower Jock Wabster--and the stopping of your father's
house will hasten the outbreak that's been sae lang biding us.

Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where
there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a
little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and
perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the
nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little
boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.

"Why, Polly, you are as good as the minister, and so, as I've had my
Sunday-morning sermon early to-day, you may go and tell Dinah that
I'll be ready for her as the clock strikes ten; but stop -- just step
round to butcher Braydon's with my compliments, and ask him if he
would lend me his light trap; I know he never uses it on the Sunday,
and it would make a wonderful difference to the horse."

Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he
came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so
much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately;
that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his
servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.

Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur, if you think your mystery
in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native
quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the
attempt for a worthy exploit; if you speed well in it, the duke shall
both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,
even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.

Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour
afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a
tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she
followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big
slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi
puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.

Why must I think how oft we two Have sate together near the river
springs, Under the green pavilion which the willow Spreads on the
floor of the unbroken fountain, Strewn, by the nurslings that linger
there, _65 Over that islet paved with flowers and moss, While the
musk-rose leaves, like flakes of crimson snow, Showered on us, and the
dove mourned in the pine, Sad prophetess of sorrows not her own?

Why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit, Whose influence is begot
of that loose grace, Which shallow laughing hearers giue to fooles: A
iests prosperitie, lies in the eare Of him that heares it, neuer in
the tongue Of him that makes it: then, if sickly eares, Deaft with the
clamors of their owne deare grones, Will heare your idle scornes;
continue then, And I will haue you, and that fault withall.

Why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by
little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly
penetrates into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater
force, it invades contracts between man and man, and from contracts
goes on to laws and constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at
last, Socrates, by an overthrow of all rights, private as well as
public.

Why now, if there were no design of which bliss Trevanion was the
object, why so frustrate the provident foresight of her mother, and
take advantage of the natural yearning of affection, the quick impulse
of youth, to hurry off a girl whose very station forbade her to take
such a journey without suitable protection,--against what must be the
wish, and what clearly were the instructions, of Lady Ellinor?

Why is it that educated men can be found to maintain that a slaughter-
house in the midst of a great city is rather a good thing than
otherwise?--that mothers persist in exposing the largest possible
amount of surface of their children to the cold, by the absurd style
of dress they adopt, and then marvel at the peculiar dispensation of
Providence, which removes their infants by bronchitis and gastric
fever?

Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb; And, for I should not deal
in her soft laws, She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe To
shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub; To make an envious mountain
on my back, Where sits deformity to mock my body; To shape my legs of
an unequal size; To disproportion me in every part, Like to a chaos,
or an unlick'd bear-whelp That carries no impression like the dam.

Why if you haue a stomacke, too't Monsieur: if you thinke your
mysterie in stratagem, can bring this instrument of honour againe into
his natiue quarter, be magnanimious in the enterprize and go on, I wil
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speede well in it, the
Duke shall both speake of it, and extend to you what further becomes
his greatnesse, euen to the vtmost syllable of your worthinesse Par.

Why, in yonder village -- the village is named Morality -- there
dwells a gentleman whose name is Legality, a very judicious man, and a
man of very good name, that has skill to help men off with such
burdens as thine are from their shoulders: yea, to my knowledge, he
hath done a great deal of good this way; ay, and besides, he hath
skill to cure those that are somewhat crazed in their wits with their
burdens.

Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time, until near the
period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was
repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a sterner and
apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of
a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was
succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personal appearance
of the corpse?

Why, you see, sir [another courtesy], the gent only arrived last night
at our hotel, sir,--the Lamb, close by Lunnun Bridge,--and he was
taken ill, and he's not quite in his right mind like; so we sent for
the doctor, and the doctor looked at the brass plate on the gent's
carpet- bag, sir, and then he looked into the 'Court Guide,' and he
said, 'There is a Mr. Caxton in Great Russell Street,--is he any
relation?

Why," said Cola, "to tell the truth, if I were to proceed against my
relations I believe I might get it; but such a thing would ruin my
business, my dear Juccio, for ever: the world would know I was worth
money, and I should get no more money from the world; so I fear I
shall hardly be able to profit by your kindness, though I shall always
consider myself as much obliged as if I had actually cleared a large
sum.

Why, I tell you, sir; he has been the only 'Bid-stand' that ever kept
New-market, Salisbury-plain, Hockley i' the Hole, Gadshill, and all
the high places of any request: he has had his mares and his geldings,
he, have been worth forty, threescore, a hundred pound a horse, would
ha' sprung you over the hedge and ditch like your greyhound: he has
done five hundred robberies in his time, more or less, I assure you.

Why, by that proportion, the court might as well take offence at him
we call the courtier, and with much more pretext, by how much the
place transcends, and goes before in dignity and virtue: but can you
imagine that any noble or true spirit in court, whose sinewy and
altogether unaffected graces, very worthily express him a courtier,
will make any exception at the opening of such as empty trunk as this
Brisk is?

`Why now, that's strange,' answered he; `neither you, nor any of my
friends, would ever allow me to know anything of the matter, and yet I
believe I _am_ as good a hand at every game as any of you all; and I
heartily wish I was to play with you only for your whole fortune: I
should desire no better sport, and I would let you name your game into
the bargain: but come, my dear boy, have you the hundred in your
pocket?

Why does not Linde attempt to explain why Harun, Walid, Razi, Al Suli,
the Khalifs, and others up to the Shahnama poem, Anna Comnena and Aben
Ezra call it chess, and nothing else, and again we ask how can he
reconcile his own author, Masudi's statement that Al Suli's chess was
declared more beautiful than all in the Caliph's garden (he died in
946), with his own statement that chess was first known in Arabia, in
954.

"Why, George," returns Mrs. Bagnet, "was always free with me, ma'am,
and when he said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things my
Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man, the
comfortablest would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line into
his mother's face or turned a hair of her head grey, then I felt sure,
from his way, that something fresh had brought his own mother into his
mind."

Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which
resides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other
valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs
through all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the
weaker and the stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them
to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or
anything else.

Why, that's the lady: all the world desires her; From the four corners
of the earth they come, To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing
saint: The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as
throughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia: The watery
kingdom, whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come As o'er a brook to see fair
Portia.

Why he was made minister of marine is difficult to say, as Spain did
not possess any; perhaps, however, from his knowledge of the English
language, which he spoke and wrote nearly as well as his own tongue,
having indeed during his sojourn in England chiefly supported himself
by writing for reviews and journals, an honourable occupation, but to
which few foreign exiles in England would be qualified to devote
themselves.

Why, to snare birds you would get up by night in the depth of winter
and tramp off in the cold; your nets were laid before the creatures
were astir, and your tracks completely covered and you actually had
birds of your own, trained to serve you and decoy their kith and kin,
while you yourself lay in some hiding-place, seeing yet unseen, and
you had learnt by long practice to jerk in the net before the birds
could fly away.

Why woman, your husband is in his olde lines againe: he so takes on
yonder with my husband, so railes against all married mankinde; so
curses all Eues daughters, of what complexion soeuer; and so buffettes
himselfe on the for-head: crying peere-out, peere-out, that any
madnesse I euer yet beheld, seem'd but tamenesse, ciuility, and
patience to this his distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat Knight
is not heere Mist.Ford.

Why is it that quackery rides rampant over the land; and that not long
ago, one of the largest public rooms in this great city could be
filled by an audience gravely listening to the reverend expositor of
the doctrine--that the simple physiological phaenomena known as
spirit-rapping, table-turning, phreno-magnetism, and I know not what
other absurd and inappropriate names, are due to the direct and
personal agency of Satan?

'Why, look you, child,' says he, 'that they are uneasy about you, that
is true; but that they have the least suspicion of the case as it is,
and as it respects you and I, is so far from being true, that they
suspect my brother Robin; and, in short, they are fully persuaded he
makes love to you; nay, the fool has put it into their heads too
himself, for he is continually bantering them about it, and making a
jest of himself.

Why, you say well: But I haue another messenger to your worship:
Mistresse Page hath her heartie commendations to you to: and let mee
tell you in your eare, shee's as fartuous a ciuill modest wife, and
one (I tell you) that will not misse you morning nor euening prayer,
as any is in Windsor, who ere bee the other: and shee bade me tell
your worship, that her husband is seldome from home, but she hopes
there will come a time.

Why Loue forswore me in my Mothers Wombe: And for I should not deale
in her soft Lawes, Shee did corrupt frayle Nature with some Bribe, To
shrinke mine Arme vp like a wither'd Shrub, To make an enuious
Mountaine on my Back, Where sits Deformitie to mocke my Body; To shape
my Legges of an vnequall size, To dis-proportion me in euery part:
Like to a Chaos, or an vn-lick'd Beare-whelpe, That carryes no
impression like the Damme.

Why then you must: but heare thee Gratiano, Thou art to wilde, to
rude, and bold of voyce, Parts that become thee happily enough, And in
such eyes as ours appeare not faults; But where they are not knowne,
why there they show Something too liberall, pray thee take paine To
allay with some cold drops of modestie Thy skipping spirit, least
through thy wilde behauiour I be misconsterd in the place I goe to,
And loose my hopes Gra.

Why it was that to speak of making her stepmother intervene, as they
might call it, in a question that seemed, just then and there, quite
peculiarly their own business--why it was that a turn so familiar and
so easy should, at the worst, strike her as charged with the spirit of
a threat, was an oddity disconnected, for her, temporarily, from its
grounds, the adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had
lost its way.

Why, then, does M. Villemain feel so strong an interest in setting
himself up as the chief of the literary classes, in playing for their
benefit the role of Trissotin in the councils of the State, and in
becoming the accomplice and associate of a band of profligates,--_soi-
disant_ men of letters,--who for more than ten years have labored with
such deplorable success to ruin public spirit, and corrupt the heart
by warping the mind?

Why humour, as 'tis 'ens', we thus define it, To be a quality of air,
or water, And in itself holds these two properties, Moisture and
fluxure: as, for demonstration, Pour water on this floor, 'twill wet
and run: Likewise the air, forced through a horn or trumpet, Flows
instantly away, and leaves behind A kind of dew; and hence we do
conclude, That whatsoe'er hath fluxure and humidity, As wanting power
to contain itself, Is humour.

"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long about
midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's
midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see
'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em
talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat
after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts
follow cat, I'm done with ye!"

Why, sold off in a jiffy, and no character, and I might find myself
slaved about under a butcher's boy, or worked to death at some seaside
place where no one cared for me, except to find out how fast I could
go, or be flogged along in some cart with three or four great men in
it going out for a Sunday spree, as I have often seen in the place I
lived in before I came here; no," said he, shaking his head, "I hope I
shall never come to that.

Why, says he, that eternal scoundrel, that Captain John Allspice of
Nahant, he used to trade to Charleston, and he carried a cargo once
there of fifty barrels of nutmegs: well, he put half a bushel of good
ones into each eend of the barrel, and the rest he filled up with
wooden ones, so like the real thing, no soul could tell the difference
until HE BIT ONE WITH HIS TEETH, and that he never thought of doing,
until he was first BIT HIMSELF.

Why was he not else a lawgiver to himself, but a transgressor, and to
be expelled by his own magistrates; both for the wanton epigrams and
dialogues which he made, and his perpetual reading of Sophron Mimus
and Aristophanes, books of grossest infamy, and also for commending
the latter of them, though he were the malicious libeller of his chief
friends, to be read by the tyrant Dionysius, who had little need of
such trash to spend his time on?

Why the devil didst not thou counsel me as well to hold an emerald or
the stone of a hyaena under my tongue, or to furnish and provide
myself with tongues of whoops, and hearts of green frogs, or to eat of
the liver and milt of some dragon, to the end that by those means I
might, at the chanting and chirping of swans and other fowls,
understand the substance of my future lot and destiny, as did of old
the Arabians in the country of Mesopotamia?

Why, of course you wanted to get in," Mr. Bucket asserts with
cheerfulness; "but for a old gentleman at your time of life--what I
call truly venerable, mind you!--with his wits sharpened, as I have no
doubt they are, by the loss of the use of his limbs, which occasions
all his animation to mount up into his head, not to consider that if
he don't keep such a business as the present as close as possible it
can't be worth a mag to him, is so curious!

Why is it that Protestantism, after carrying everything before it in a
time of comparatively little knowledge and little freedom, should make
no perceptible progress in a reasoning and tolerant age; that the
Luthers, the Calvins, the Knoxes, the Zwingles, should have left no
successors; that during two centuries and a half fewer converts should
have been brought over from the Church of Rome than at the time of the
Reformation were sometimes gained in a year?

Why FOR a name unknown, Whose fame unblown Sleeps in the hills For
ever and aye; For her who hears The stir of the years Go by on the
wind By night and day; And heeds no thing Of the needs of spring, Of
autumn's wonder Or winter's chill; For one who sees The great sun
freeze, As he wanders a-cold From hill to hill; And all her heart Is a
woven part Of the flurry and drift Of whirling snow; For the sake of
two Sad eyes and true, And the old, old love So long ago.

Why, this Will lug your priests and servants from your sides, Pluck
stout men's pillows from below their head: This yellow slave Will knit
and break religions; bless the accurs'd, Make the hoar leprosy ador'd;
place thieves, And give them title, knee, and approbation, With
senators on the bench; this is it That makes the wappen'd widow wed
again; She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores Would cast the
gorge at, this embalms and spices To the April day again.

Why," said the boy, "I will plant myself in the doorway just as he
does, and then when he wants to go in to breakfast I will say 'You
cannot have breakfast yet: HE is busy with some people,' and when he
comes for dinner I will say 'No dinner yet: HE is in his bath,' and as
he grows ravenous I will say 'Wait a little: HE is with the ladies of
the court,' until I have plagued and tormented him as he torments me,
keeping me away from you, grandfather, when I want to come.

Why then to thee thou Siluer treasure house, Tell me once more, what
title thou doost beare; Who chooseth me shall get as much as he
deserues: And well said too; for who shall goe about To cosen Fortune,
and be honourable Without the stampe of merrit, let none presume To
weare an vndeserued dignitie: O that estates, degrees, and offices,
Were not deriu'd corruptly, and that cleare honour Were purchast by
the merrit of the wearer; How many then should couer that stand bare?

Why is Peireskius, or any man else, to be abused for an appetite for
that, or any other morsel of sound knowledge: For notwithstanding I
know nothing of the chariot in question, continued he, the inventor of
it must have had a very mechanical head; and tho' I cannot guess upon
what principles of philosophy he has atchieved it;--yet certainly his
machine has been constructed upon solid ones, be they what they will,
or it could not have answered at the rate my brother mentions.

Why here, in Duke Friedland's headquarters, 'tie plain If for every
thunder, and every blast, Which blazing ye from your tongue-points
cast, The bells were but rung, in the country round, Not a bellman, I
ween, would there soon be found; And if for each and every unholy
prayer Which to vent from your jabbering jaws you dare, From your
noddles were plucked but the smallest hair, Ev'ry crop would be
smoothed ere the sun went down, Though at morn 'twere as bushy as
Absalom's crown.

Why may I not hope then by such perseverance at last to gain those
inclinations, in which for the future I shall, perhaps, have no rival;
for as for this lord, Mr Western is so kind to prefer me to him; and
sure, sir, you will not deny but that a parent hath at least a
negative voice in these matters; nay, I have heard this very young
lady herself say so more than once, and declare that she thought
children inexcusable who married in direct opposition to the will of
their parents.

Why, dost thou believe that I, who am all-powerful, I, whose
loveliness is more than the loveliness of the Grecian Helen, of whom
they used to sing, and whose wisdom is wider, ay, far more wide and
deep than the wisdom of Solomon the Wise--I, who know the secrets of
the earth and its riches, and can turn all things to my uses--I, who
have even for a while overcome Change, that ye call Death--why, I say,
oh stranger, dost thou think that I herd here with barbarians lower
than the beasts?

'Why, instead of my friend's bursting into tears when he knew who Fred
was, embracing him kindly, and telling him that he was his
grandfather, or his grandmother in disguise (which we fully expected),
he flew into a tremendous passion; called him all manner of names;
said it was in a great measure his fault that little Nell and the old
gentleman had ever been brought to poverty; didn't hint at our taking
anything to drink; and--and in short rather turned us out of the room
than otherwise.

Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady's
face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring,
--a ring that I must use In dear employment: therefore hence, be
gone:-- But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I further
shall intend to do, By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint, And
strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs: The time and my intents
are savage-wild; More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers
or the roaring sea.

Why, to tell long stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through
morally rotting in my corner, through lack of fitting environment,
through divorce from real life, and rankling spite in my underground
world, would certainly not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and
all the traits for an anti-hero are EXPRESSLY gathered together here,
and what matters most, it all produces an unpleasant impression, for
we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples, every one of us,
more or less.

Why, my good lord," answered she, "do you think any woman in England
would not laugh at you in her heart, whatever prudery she might wear
in her countenance?----You force me to use a strange kind of language,
and to betray my sex most abominably; but I am contented with knowing
my intentions are good, and that I am endeavouring to serve my cousin;
for I think you will make her a husband notwithstanding this; or, upon
my soul, I would not even persuade her to fling herself away upon an
empty title.

Why, he'll snap your head off for a word Why he enjoyed the privilege
of seeing, and was not beside her Wife and no wife, a prisoner in
liberty Wilfrid perceived that he had become an old man Will not admit
the existence of a virtue in an opposite opinion William John Fleming
was simply a poor farmer Win you--temperately, let us hope; by storm,
if need be Winds of panic are violently engaged in occupying the
vacuum Wins everywhere back a reflection of its own kindliness Winter
mornings are divine.

Why I descend into this bed of death, Is partly to behold my Ladies
face: But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger, A precious
Ring, a Ring that I must vse, In deare employment, therefore hence be
gone: But if thou iealous dost returne to prie In what I further shall
intend to do, By heauen I will teare thee ioynt by ioynt, And strew
this hungry Churchyard with thy limbs: The time, and my intents are
sauage wilde: More fierce and more inexorable farre, Them emptie
Tygers, or the roaring Sea Pet.

Why, so he<168> is, Casane; I am here: But yet I'll save their lives,
and make them slaves.-- Ye petty kings of Turkey, I am come, As Hector
did into the Grecian camp, To overdare the pride of Graecia, And set
his warlike person to the view Of fierce Achilles, rival of his fame:
I do you honour in the simile; For, if I should, as Hector did
Achilles, (The worthiest knight that ever brandish'd sword,) Challenge
in combat any of you all, I see how fearfully ye would refuse, And fly
my glove as from a scorpion.

Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging About his neck,
Bohemia: who--if I Had servants true about me, that bare eyes To see
alike mine honour as their profits, Their own particular thrifts,--
they would do that Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou, His
cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form Have bench'd and rear'd to
worship; who mayst see, Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees
heaven, How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup, To give mine enemy a
lasting wink; Which draught to me were cordial.

Why, only the other day I heard our master say to Mrs. Blomefield, `My
dear madam, you need not be anxious about the children; my old
Merrylegs will take as much care of them as you or I could; I assure
you I would not sell that pony for any money, he is so perfectly good-
tempered and trustworthy;' and do you think I am such an ungrateful
brute as to forget all the kind treatment I have had here for five
years, and all the trust they place in me, and turn vicious because a
couple of ignorant boys used me badly?

Why, assure you, signior, rich apparel has strange virtues: it makes
him that hath it without means, esteemed for an excellent wit: he that
enjoys it with means, puts the world in remembrance of his means: it
helps the deformities of nature, and gives lustre to her beauties;
makes continual holiday where it shines; sets the wits of ladies at
work, that otherwise would be idle; furnisheth your two-shilling
ordinary; takes possession of your stage at your new play; and
enricheth your oars, as scorning to go with your scull.

Why he that weares her like her Medull, hanging About his neck
(Bohemia) who, if I Had Seruants true about me, that bare eyes To see
alike mine Honor, as their Profits, (Their owne particular Thrifts)
they would doe that Which should vndoe more doing: I, and thou His
Cup-bearer, whom I from meaner forme Haue Bench'd, and rear'd to
Worship, who may'st see Plainely, as Heauen sees Earth, and Earth sees
Heauen, How I am gall'd, might'st be-spice a Cup, To giue mine Enemy a
lasting Winke: Which Draught to me, were cordiall Cam.

Why had I not with charitable hand Tooke vp a beggars issue at my
gates, Who smeered thus, and mir'd with infamie, I might haue said, no
part of it is mine: This shame deriues it selfe from vnknowne loines,
But mine, and mine I lou'd, and mine I prais'd, And mine that I was
proud on mine so much, That I my selfe, was to my selfe not mine:
Valewing of her, why she, O she is falne Into a pit of Inke, that the
wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her cleane againe, And salt too
little, which may season giue To her foule tainted flesh Ben.

Why, I remember the time when old Maunders as had three-and-twenty
wans--I remember the time when old Maunders had in his cottage in Spa
Fields in the winter time, when the season was over, eight male and
female dwarfs setting down to dinner every day, who was waited on by
eight old giants in green coats, red smalls, blue cotton stockings,
and high-lows: and there was one dwarf as had grown elderly and
wicious who whenever his giant wasn't quick enough to please him, used
to stick pins in his legs, not being able to reach up any higher.

Why, sir, replied I, I cannot help being grieved for the poor mother
of this sweet babe, to think, if she be living, that she must call her
chiefest delight her shame: If she be no more, that she must have had
such remorse on her poor mind, when she came to leave the world, and
her little babe: And, in the second place, I grieve, that it must be
thought a kindness to the dear little soul, not to let her know how
near the dearest relation she has in the world is to her.--Forgive me,
dear sir, I say not this to reproach you, in the least.

Why then I doe but dreame on Soueraigntie, Like one that stands vpon a
Promontorie, And spyes a farre-off shore, where hee would tread,
Wishing his foot were equall with his eye, And chides the Sea, that
sunders him from thence, Saying, hee'le lade it dry, to haue his way:
So doe I wish the Crowne, being so farre off, And so I chide the
meanes that keepes me from it, And so (I say) Ile cut the Causes off,
Flattering me with impossibilities: My Eyes too quicke, my Heart o're-
weenes too much, Vnlesse my Hand and Strength could equall them.

'Why, that Mr Watkins, my dear,' said Mrs Nickleby slowly, as if she
were making a tremendous effort to recollect something of paramount
importance; 'that Mr Watkins--he wasn't any relation, Miss Knag will
understand, to the Watkins who kept the Old Boar in the village; by-
the-bye, I don't remember whether it was the Old Boar or the George
the Third, but it was one of the two, I know, and it's much the same--
that Mr Watkins said, when you were only two years and a half old,
that you were one of the most astonishing children he ever saw.

Why, said he, there is a turning in the road, about five miles off,
that goes round a meadow, that has a pleasant foot-way, by the side of
a little brook, and a double row of limes on each side, where now and
then the gentry in the neighbourhood walk, and angle, and divert
themselves.-- I'll shew it you next opportunity.--And I stept out of
my chariot, to walk across this meadow, and bid Robin meet me with it
on the further part of it: And whom should I 'spy there, walking, with
a book in his hand, reading, but your humble servant Mr. Williams!

Why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and
rivets the soul to the body, until she becomes like the body, and
believes that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from
agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged to
have the same habits and haunts, and is not likely ever to be pure at
her departure to the world below, but is always infected by the body;
and so she sinks into another body and there germinates and grows, and
has therefore no part in the communion of the divine and pure and
simple.

Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course
of a quarter of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother,
and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him
from mixing in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed
it much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a
private education; while he himself, though probably without any
particular, any material superiority by nature, merely from the
advantage of a public school, was as well fitted to mix in the world
as any other man.

Why, of two brothers, rich and restless one Ploughs, burns, manures,
and toils from sun to sun; The other slights, for women, sports, and
wines, All Townshend's turnips, and all Grosvenor's mines; Why one
like Bu--- with pay and scorn content, Bows and votes on, in Court and
Parliament; One, driven by strong benevolence of soul, Shall fly, like
Oglethorpe, from pole to pole; Is known alone to that directing power,
Who forms the genius in the natal hour; That God of Nature, who,
within us still, Inclines our action, not constrains our will: Various
of temper, as of face or frame.

Why did not so noble a conquest fall under Alexander, or the ancient
Greeks and Romans; and so great a revolution and mutation of so many
empires and nations, fall into hands that would have gently levelled,
rooted up, and made plain and smooth whatever was rough and savage
amongst them, and that would have cherished and propagated the good
seeds that nature had there produced; mixing not only with the culture
of land and the ornament of cities, the arts of this part of the
world, in what was necessary, but also the Greek and Roman virtues,
with those that were original of the country?

Why, at Netley's butcher shop (established in 1882) there are no less
than four men working on the sausage machines in the basement; at the
Newspacket office there are as many more job-printing; there is a long
distance telephone with four distracting girls on high stools wearing
steel caps and talking incessantly; in the offices in McCarthy's block
are dentists and lawyers with their coats off, ready to work at any
moment; and from the big planing factory down beside the lake where
the railroad siding is, you may hear all through the hours of the
summer afternoon the long-drawn music of the running saw.

Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being a knight
nor having any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage nor the
will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know that
in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants
are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is
no fear of their making some move to change matters once more, and
try, as they say, what chance may do for them; so it is essential that
the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern, and
valour to attack and defend himself, whatever may befall him.

Why, let me see, my dearest, said he--But I think of no more at
present: For it would be needless to say how much I value you for your
natural sweetness of temper, and that open cheerfulness of
countenance, which adorns you, when nothing has given my fairest
apprehensions for her virtue: A sweetness, and a cheerfulness, that
prepossesses in your favour, at first sight, the mind of every one
that beholds you.--I need not, I hope, say, that I would have you
diligently preserve this sweet appearance: Let no thwarting accident,
no cross fortune, (for we must not expect to be exempt from such,
happy as we now are in each other!

Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and then goes to the
Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne into London, vnder the forme
of a Souldier: and such fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders
Names, and they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done; at
such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy: who came
off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac'd, what termes the Enemy stood
on: and this they conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they
tricke vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls
Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among foming Bottles,
and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull to be thought on: but you must
learne to know such slanders of the age, or else you may be
maruellously mistooke Flu.

Why, your good angel, Pamela, said he; for when I began to consider,
that it would have made you miserable, and me not happy; that if you
should have a dear little one, it would be out of my own power to
legitimate it, if I should wish it to inherit my estate; and that, as
I am almost the last of my family, and most of what I possess must
descend to a strange line, and disagreeable and unworthy persons;
notwithstanding that I might, in this case, have issue of my own body;
when I further considered your untainted virtue, what dangers and
trials you had undergone by my means, and what a world of troubles I
had involved you in, only because you were beautiful and virtuous,
which had excited all my passion for you; and reflected also upon your
tried prudence and truth!

Why then, proceeded he, the case was this: Pamela, I find, when she
was in the time of her confinement, (that is, added he, when she was
taken prisoner, in order to make me one; for that is the upshot of the
matter,) in the journal she kept, which was intended for nobody's
perusal but her parents, tells them, that she was importuned, one
Sunday, by Mrs. Jewkes, to sing a psalm; but her spirits not
permitting, she declined it: But after Mrs. Jewkes was gone down, she
says, she recollected, that the cxxxviith psalm was applicable to her
own case; Mrs. Jewkes having often, on other days, in vain, besought
her to sing a song: That thereupon she turned it more to her own
supposed case; and believing Mrs. Jewkes had a design against her
honour, and looking upon her as her gaoler, she thus gives her version
of this psalm.

Why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak French, and the
next English; why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on
the piano, the sounds of which were audible in their brother's room
above, where the students used to work; why they were visited by those
professors of French literature, of music, of drawing, of dancing; why
at certain hours all the three young ladies, with Mademoiselle Linon,
drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin
cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia in a half-long one, and Kitty in
one so short that her shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were
visible to all beholders; why it was they had to walk about the
Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat
--all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he
did not understand, but he was sure that everything that was done
there was very good, and he was in love precisely with the mystery of
the proceedings.

Why, Petruchio is coming, in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of
old breeches thrice turned; a pair of boots that have been candle-
cases, one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken
points: his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no
kindred; besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the
chine; troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of
windgalls, sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the
fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed
in the back and shoulder-shotten; near-legged before, and with a half-
checked bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather, which, being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now
repaired with knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman's crupper
of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in
studs, and here and there pieced with pack-thread.
