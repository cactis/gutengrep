<p>In training he had been, once upon a time, an engineer and built dams that broke and bridges that fell down and wharves that ftoated away in the spring floods.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at the moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was bright moonlight.</p>

<p>With the moonlight scene opening this stanza, cp.</p>

<p>And I sat by moonlight amid the necropolis of Memphis.</p>

<p>With your guitar under the windows, of moonlight nights!</p>

<p>They walked in the moonlight by the railings of the park.</p>

<p>Blindman&#8217;s buff was a great favorite for moonlight nights.</p>

<p>I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight.</p>

<p>On a moonlight night Flood Ireson was roused by knocking at his door.</p>

<p>Black against the square of moonlight I saw him stagger, I saw him fall.</p>

<p>Ah, darling,&#8220; she said, &#8221;take me away from this horrible white moonlight!</p>

<p>The stage is dark, but the lake and glaciers glisten in the moonlight.</p>

<p>A ray of moonlight poured through the trees, and lighted up the face of the dead.</p>

<p>He crossed to the other side of the street, and Farina followed out of the moonlight.</p>

<p>The sweet charm of warm nights and of streams glittering in the moonlight penetrated us.</p>

<p>Yonder in a space of moonlight on lush grass, the beams were as white fire to sight and feeling.</p>

<p>After dinner we took a walk by moonlight, and I whispered all the tender things I could think of to her.</p>

<p>I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day.</p>

<p>Dunnoo, with his face ashy grey in the moonlight, implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once.</p>

<p>No; moonlight was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head.</p>

<p>As soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst into the room.</p>

<p>I saw all the stone statues standing in the moonlight; and I myself was like one of those stone statues walking.</p>

<p>In the obscured moonlight I supposed it was a native dog, but it was white, and looked exactly like a large fat lamb.</p>

<p>Strolling in the cool moonlight, I was attracted by a brilliant light beneath the trees, and cautiously approached it.</p>

<p>His images may be obscure, from the moonlight haze in which they float, but they are rarely so through faults of diction.</p>

<p>Jack was standing in the middle of the stall, and by the moonlight Tip could see he was smiling just as jovially as ever.</p>

<p>Look at the first movement, and judge whether there are not in it more pale moonlight reveries than fresh morning thoughts.</p>

<p>Waternomee Falls, on Hurricane Creek, at Warren, are bordered with rich moss where fairies used to dance and sing in the moonlight.</p>

<p>When Robin came out of the inn, he found young Richard Partington sitting upon his horse in the white moonlight, awaiting his coming.</p>

<p>Its origin is due to Rellstab, who, in describing the first movement, drew a picture of a small boat in the moonlight on Lake Lucerne.</p>

<p>John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wall-paper till I felt creepy.</p>

<p>Amidst the pastoral scenes, and under the tranquil moonlight of the New, the Old World, even in me, rude Bushman, claimed for a while its son.</p>

<p>It was a very weird and desolate place; and everything looked dark and dismal, under the moonlight, as it streamed between stormy black clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Francis Osbaldistone,&#8221; cries the girl&#8217;s voice through the moonlight, &#8220;should not whistle his favourite airs when he wishes to remain undiscovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind me lay the yard, vividly black-and-white in the moonlight, and the pile of wood and faggots on which Moreau and his mutilated victims lay, one over another.</p>

<p>Finally, after studying the map carefully in the moonlight which now flooded the room, I pointed out a waterway far to the north of us which also seemed to lead to Helium.</p>

<p>day; sunshine; light of day, light of heaven; moonlight, starlight, sun &amp;c. (luminary) 432 light; daylight, broad daylight, noontide light; noontide, noonday, noonday sun.</p>

<p>Too capricious and imperious in all she does to be the cause of much surprise in those about her as to anything she does, this woman, loosely muffled, goes out into the moonlight.</p>

<p>As I did so I saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge, and level, cacti-studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of soft splendor and wondrous enchantment.</p>

<p>Some of them, like _Our Love is not a Fading Earthly Flower_, _O Moonlight Deep and Tender_, _To the Dandelion_, and _The First Snow-Fall_ are exquisite lyrics of nature and sentiment.</p>

<p>And then the moonlight flooded the cave, and there before me lay my own body as it had been lying all these hours, with the eyes staring toward the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground.</p>

<p>On the sword-point gleams the moonlight, On the blade the sun is shining, On the hilt the bright stars twinkle, On the edge a horse is neighing, On the handle plays a kitten, On the sheath a dog is barking.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the king, whose longing was excessive, could not be satisfied with devouring her form, which poured forth a stream of the nectar of beauty, as the partridge cannot be satisfied with devouring the moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was impossible to travel through this region at night, even by moonlight; we should have lost our eyes upon the sticks and branches of the direful scrubs if we had attempted it, besides tearing our skin and clothes to pieces also.</p>

<p>The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and moth.</p>

<p>In winter, when the ground is covered with snow, what grand times they have a slayin over these here mashes with the galls, or playin ball on the ice, or goin to quiltin frolics of nice long winter evenings and then a drivin home like mad, by moonlight.</p>

<p>At length I arose, opened the window, and stood by it for some time in the clear moonlight, receiving, in part at least, that refreshment and dissipation of ideas from the clear and calm scene, without which they had become beyond the command of my own volition.</p>

<p>Buddhism does not acknowledge the efficacy of prayers; and in the warm countries where Buddhists live, the occasional reading of the law, or preaching of the word, in public, can take place best in the open air, by moonlight, under a simple roof of trees or palms.</p>

<p>Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics; propose to mat the deck; think of having hangings to the top; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle.</p>

<p>You remember where we held That conversation;--nay, we see the spot Even from this cypress;--two long years are past Since, on an April midnight, underneath _5 The moonlight ruins of Mount Palatine, I did confess to you my secret mind.</p>

<p>Yellow mist Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank _605 Wan moonlight even to fulness; not a star Shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds, Danger&#8217;s grim playmates, on that precipice Slept, clasped in his embrace.--O, storm of death!</p>

<p>&#8220;for waning beauty, Childhood vanished, youth departed, Silver sunshine, golden moonlight, Hope and pleasure of my childhood, Taken from me now forever, And so soon to be forgotten At the tool-bench of my brother, At the window of my sister, In the cottage of my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>in my head; Then a Face came, blind and weeping, And It couldn&#8217;t wipe its eyes, And It muttered I was keeping Back the moonlight from the skies; So I patted it for pity, But it whistled shrill with wrath, And a huge black Devil City Poured its peoples on my path.</p>

<p>The upholsterer&#8217;s where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and my bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near the window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him (as I did one moonlight night) leaning against the post and evidenfly catching cold.</p>

<p>The day after the letter arrived in New Orleans, Susan and Emmeline were attached, and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the following morning; and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight which steals through the grated window, we may listen to their conversation.</p>

<p>Not Miss Crawley--she preferred her carriage--but the walk over the Rectory fields, and in at the little park wicket, and through the dark plantation, and up the checkered avenue to Queen&#8217;s Crawley, was charming in the moonlight to two such lovers of the picturesque as the Captain and Miss Rebecca.</p>

<p>As we skirted along the coast, Wilson and I recognized, or thought we did, in the clear moonlight, the rude white Mission of San Juan Capistrano, and its cliff, from which I had swung down by a pair of halyards to save a few hides,--a boy who could not be prudential, and who caught at every chance for adventure.</p>

<p>And Philippe did collect all his forces, a great and noble army, and came one night to the hill of Sangate, just behind the English army, the knights&#8217; armor glancing and their pennons flying in the moonlight, so as to be a beautiful sight to the hungry garrison who could see the white tents pitched upon the hillside.</p>

<p>The thread which the spiders had spun far over the seas, which her grandmother had sat in the moonlight and spun again for her, which she had tempered in the rose-fire and tied to her opal ring, had left her - had gone where she could no longer follow it - had brought her into a horrible cavern, and there left her!</p>

<p>Though Siddhartha fled from the self a thousand times, stayed in nothingness, stayed in the animal, in the stone, the return was inevitable, inescapable was the hour, when he found himself back in the sunshine or in the moonlight, in the shade or in the rain, and was once again his self and Siddhartha, and again felt the agony of the cycle which had been forced upon him.</p>

<p>I had no horse, and the deep and wheeling stream of the river, rendered turbid by the late tumult of which its channel had been the scene, and seeming yet more so under the doubtful influence of an imperfect moonlight, had no inviting influence for a pedestrian by no means accustomed to wade rivers, and who had lately seen horsemen weltering, in this dangerous passage, up to the very saddle-laps.</p>

<p>They were all love, lovers, sweethearts, persecuted ladies fainting in lonely pavilions, postilions killed at every stage, horses ridden to death on every page, sombre forests, heartaches, vows, sobs, tears and kisses, little skiffs by moonlight, nightingales in shady groves, &#8220;gentlemen&#8221; brave as lions, gentle as lambs, virtuous as no one ever was, always well dressed, and weeping like fountains.</p>

<p>went on to say, that from his window he had afterwards, and late at night, seen my aunt give this person money outside the garden rails in the moonlight, who then slunk away - into the ground again, as he thought probable - and was seen no more: while my aunt came hurriedly and secretly back into the house, and had, even that morning, been quite different from her usual self; which preyed on Mr. Dick&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>Madame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the continual silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings, she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone, which, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes, seemed like &#8220;moonlight on a statue,&#8221; -- yielding light without warmth.</p>

<p>A placid sea, which after much disturbance had sighed itself to rest, and a high, steady barometer promised a fifty hours&#8217; passage to Yokohama, and when Dr. and Mrs. Hepburn and I left Hakodate, by moonlight, on the night of the 14th, as the only passengers in the Hiogo Maru, Captain Moore, her genial, pleasant master, congratulated us on the rapid and delightful passage before us, and we separated at midnight with many projects for pleasant intercourse and occupation.</p>

<p>Thou, O Ukko, art my father, Thou hast given me form and feature; As the sea-gull on the ocean, As the duck upon the waters, Shines the Sun upon the swallow, Shines as bright upon the sparrow, Gives the joy-birds song and gladness, Does not shine on me unhappy; Nevermore will shine the sunlight, Never will the moonlight glimmer On this hapless son and orphan; Do not know my hero-father, Cannot tell who was my mother; On the shore, perhaps the gray-duck Left me in the sand to perish.</p>

<p>And perhaps some evening next spring, moved by a beam of moonlight falling through the branches on the grass at their feet, they will join and press their hands in memory of all this cruel and suppressed suffering; and, perhaps, also this short embrace may infuse in their veins a little of this thrill which they would not have known without it, and will give to those two dead souls, brought to life in a second, the rapid and divine sensation of this intoxication, of this madness which gives to lovers more happiness in an instant than other men can gather during a whole lifetime!</p>

<p>-- Porpoises -- Alligators -- Silchar -- Tigers -- Rice crops -- Cookies -- Munniporees -- Hockey -- Varnish -- Dance -- Nagas -- Excursion to Munnipore frontier -- Elephant bogged -- Bamboos -- _Cardiopteris_ -- Climate, etc., of Cachar -- Mosquitos -- Fall of banks -- Silhet -- Oaks -- _Stylidium_ -- Tree-ferns -- Chattuc -- Megna -- Meteorology -- Palms -- Noacolly -- Salt-smuggling -- Delta of Ganges and Megna -- Westward progress of Megna -- Peat -- Tide -- Waves -- Earthquakes -- Dangerous navigation -- Moonlight scenes -- Mud island -- Chittagong -- Mug tribes -- Views -- Trees -- Churs -- Flagstaff hill -- Coffee -- Pepper -- Tea, etc.</p>

<p>Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the reader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes of the Salpetriere covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in the moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows of black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and of darkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in the midst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single candle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil, Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not losing a word, not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and pistol in hand.</p>

<p>So the poor little cinder maid married the Prince, and in time they came to be King and Queen, and lived happily ever after.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter2chapter2a"><a id="chapter2">Chapter 2</a></h2>

<p>Once upon a time it happened that a man journeying from Elam arrived in Sodom toward evening.</p>

<p>he asked.</p>

<p>he asked.</p>

<p>she asked.</p>

<p>she asked.</p>

<p>asked Nell.</p>

<p>asked Athos.</p>

<p>I asked him.</p>

<p>asked Drouet.</p>

<p>asked Spilett.</p>

<p>asked Freddie.</p>

<p>asked Natasha.</p>

<p>Shinshin asked.</p>

<p>asked the child.</p>

<p>asked the Mouse.</p>

<p>asked Catharine.</p>

<p>asked her mother.</p>

<p>asked the Woodman.</p>

<p>asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>asked Hurstwood, quietly.</p>

<p>asked Mazarin, turning pale.</p>

<p>asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.</p>

<p>asked March, in an altered accent.</p>

<p>Tsze-chang asked about government.</p>

<p>he asked with much concern, &quot;Let me.</p>

<p>asked Jack, glancing around fearfully.</p>

<p>asked the captain of the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>asked a monk of Hwui Chung on one occasion.</p>

<p>asked Marguerite, as she took the Prince&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>He asked: &#8220;Is Maitre Hauchecorne, of Breaute, here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later somebody asked him, &#8220;Where&#8217;s father?&#8221;</p>

<p>When asked what he brought, he professed skill in leechcraft.</p>

<p>the latter asked, after returning his nephew&#8217;s on-duty salute.</p>

<p>They asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy went in search of him.</p>

<p>asked Catharine, blushing, &#8220;has he no message from the king to bring me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Polly asked no questions, but opened the door and held the lantern for him.</p>

<p>On that day shall neither man nor djinn be asked of his sin: Which, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it, possibly,&#8221; Charlotte asked, &#8220;not quite enough to marry me for?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at the water and asked with surprise, &#8220;This is the water you drink?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my bonnet, looking at me all the while.</p>

<p>asked D&#8217;Artagnan, in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery.</p>

<p>Then he accosted the youth and saluting him, asked him, &quot;Why do I see my lord lone and lorn?</p>

<p>Kung-sun Ch&#8217;ao of Wei asked Tsze-kung, saying, &#8216;From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?&#8217;</p>

<p>He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing _peculiar_ at the scene of the atrocity.</p>

<p>All the Plumstead party had of course been asked, at the time of the invitation Eleanor had intended to have gone with her sister.</p>

<p>There was a crafty miller, and he Had lusty sons, one, two, and three: He called them all, and asked their will, If that to them he left his mill.</p>

<p>In truth, but one thing now--better have died Thrice than have asked it once--could make me stay-- That proof of trust--so often asked in vain!</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed,&#8220; asked Anne reflectively, &#8221;that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable?</p>

<p>Consequently, though I was the gendarme and therefore bound to apprehend him, I only asked him anxiously, when I reached him, if he had hurt himself very much.</p>

<p>That the dainty maiden should dance and weep at the same time was indeed surprising; so Dorothy asked in a soft, sympathetic voice: &#8220;Are you unhappy, little girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was with this longing to repeat the few haunting notes that hummed in his brain that Nils went to the schoolmaster one day and asked him for the loan of his fiddle.</p>

<p>Turning, he saw a circular disc reticulated with creases, and recognized the smiling countenance of the fat woman who had asked for another song at the Three Mariners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the King, &#8220;you would have us fail of the faith which we pledged to the damsel, who asked you in marriage by way of guerdon for our restoration to health.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went near to one of them that stood by, and asked the truth of him concerning all these things, and he told me the interpretation of the words, and instructed me: 7:17.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really now, in our own yard- we asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them be taken... where&#8217;s the hurry?&#8221;</p>

<p>He called upon the ladies the next day; he rode by their side in the Park; he asked their party to a great dinner at a restaurateur&#8217;s, and was quite wild with exultation when they agreed to come.</p>

<p>Thereupon Ghanim&#8217;s heart sank and desire grew on him as its object offered difficulties; and he improvised these verses, &quot;I asked the author of mine ills * To heal the wound with one sweet kiss: No!</p>

<p>asked the Badawi; and Ja&#8217;afar answered, &quot;Take three ounces of wind-breaths and the like of sunbeams and the same of moonshine and as much of lamp-light; mix them well together and let them lie in the wind three months.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,&#8221; echoed that basest of swindlers, Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; &#8220;and it&#8217;s no more than your merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the money!&#8221;</p>

<p>My father, seeing me downcast, asked to know the cause of my sadness, and I replied that I was suffering with my liver, but in truth I was mourning more than all my brethren, seeing that I had been the cause of Joseph&#8217;s sale.</p>

<p>So on the morn Sir Gawaine took his leave of his host Sir Carados, and rode into the forest; and at the last he met with Sir Pelleas, making great moan out of measure, so each of them saluted other, and asked him why he made such sorrow.</p>

<p>He remembered he had not asked why she was not of the party in the morning, or where she was; he remembered he had not thought of her; and, from shame, he was ready to make any amends, the more so as he was about to plunge her into such acute grief.</p>

<p>Gismondo’s wife, noticing my frequent presence in that house-she was a lady as courteous as could be, and of surpassing beauty-came up to me one day, looked at my drawings, and asked me if I was a sculptor or a painter; to whom I said I was a goldsmith.</p>

<p>M. Corvisart excused himself, asked the Emperor how he had been affected, what remedies he had used, and promised always to leave word where he could be found, in order that he might be summoned immediately on his Majesty&#8217;s orders, and the Emperor was soon appeased.</p>

<p>I have talked once or twice among ladies about principles and ideas, but they put their fans before their faces, and told me I was too wise for them, who for their part never pretended to read any thing but the play-bill, and then asked me the price of my best head.</p>

<p>So she opened the door and he entered and saluted her with the salam; whereupon she returned his salute and asked his need; and he replied, &quot;The Lady Zubaydah, daughter of Al-Kasim[FN#91] and queen-spouse of the Commander of the Faithful Harun al-Rashid sixth[FN#92] of the sons of Al-Abbas, paternal uncle of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!)</p>

<p>Presently the Sovran of that capital came out and greeted them and asked them the cause of their coming; so they informed him of their adventures from commencement to conclusion; and he, when certified of the truth of this tale, returned to inform his daughter thereof.--And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>Elder Perry Bradley left Carthage, Leek County, Mississippi, in January, 1880, and testifies to the following facts: &quot;In October, 1879, twenty-five or thirty masked men went into Peter Watson&#8217;s house, and took him from his bed, amid screams of &#8216;murder&#8217; from his wife and seven children; but the only reply the wife and children received at the hands of the desperadoes was a beating.</p>

<p>On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him.</p>

<p>That being done, he asked of Panurge the horoscope of his nativity, which was no sooner by Panurge tendered unto him, than that, erecting a figure, he very promptly and speedily formed and fashioned a complete fabric of the houses of heaven in all their parts, whereof when he had considered the situation and the aspects in their triplicities, he fetched a deep sigh, and said: I have clearly enough already discovered unto you the fate of your cuckoldry, which is unavoidable, you cannot escape it.</p>

<p>44° 19&#8217; 36 N. we observed Some Indians on a hill on the S. S. one Came to the river &amp; fired off his gun and asked us to come he wish us to go to his Camp near at hand we refused, passed a large Island on the S. S., here we expected the Tetons would attempt to Stop us, and prepared for action, &amp;c. opposit this Island on the L. S. a Small Creek comes in, we call this Caution Island, Camped on a Sand bar 1/2 mile from the main Shore the wind hard from the N W. Cold, the current of the river less rapid, &amp; retains less Sediment than below.</p>

<p>They were glad to face the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you want to see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why do you not take your money?</p>

<p>But why do I mention justification?</p>

<p>But why all this about oak or stone?</p>

<p>But why suspect me before the action?</p>

<p>But why did not you look for the steps?</p>

<p>--But why do you fear a bit of bread?</p>

<p>But why the mischief didn&#8217;t he say so?&#8217;</p>

<p>But why are these things alone res mancipi?</p>

<p>But why should I enlarge further upon this?</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you not rise and greet your guest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should such an idea cross your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why any proclamation now upon this subject?</p>

<p>But why does he so intensely yearn for the prayers and devotions of our hearts?</p>

<p>But why,&#8220; I asked, still somewhat bewildered, &#8221;didn&#8217;t you apply for a commission?</p>

<p>But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd&#8217;st in vain?</p>

<p>But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State Government set up in this particular way?</p>

<p>&#8220;But why dost thou not bid him contrive some trick to get the girl Jessamine for my son Hahzalam Bazazah?&#8221;</p>

<p>But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State government set up in this particular way ?</p>

<p>But why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created there, it would be very difficult to explain.</p>

<p>But why commands the king That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, While he himself keeps in the cold field?</p>

<p>But why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain was just conceiving .</p>

<p>But why castration should lead to the reappearance of an early condition of the horns cannot be explained with any certainty.</p>

<p>But why, if you please, captain,&#8220; asked Pencroft, knitting his brows, &#8221;why should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided?</p>

<p>But why did she say, &#8216;We change countries,&#8217; and immediately flush, break and falter, lose command of her English, grow pale and swoon; why?</p>

<p>But why d&#8217;you s&#8217;pose I feel so--so--like I&#8217;d found something I&#8217;d missed and been looking for--&#8217;s if this was the right place for me to fit in?</p>

<p>But why should man seek glory, who of his own Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation, ignominy, and shame-- Who, for so many benefits received, Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false, And so of all true good himself despoiled; Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take 140 That which to God alone of right belongs?</p>

<p>But if any fraud or treachery is practising against him, I hope that simple love and truth will be strong in the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter4chapter4a"><a id="chapter4">Chapter 4</a></h2>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a queen -- a powerful monarch -- who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe; and a minister; and this minister wished much to injure the queen, whom once he had loved too well.</p>

<p>PRINCESS.</p>

<p>[To PRINCESS EBOLI.</p>

<p>Command me, princess!</p>

<p>Princess Mary did not answer.</p>

<p>Princess: Admit them!</p>

<p>Daryabar, History of the Princess of, iii.</p>

<p>almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess Dunya, the King&#8217;s daughter, is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why had that disgusting princess looked at my legs?</p>

<p>Princesse, ma parole, je n&#8217;ai pas voulu l&#8217;offenser.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t mind Mr. Joker,&quot; said the Princess to Dorothy.</p>

<p>and the princess in danger of having her reputation hurt!</p>

<p>Spice of the princess&#8217;s conversation flavoured her speech.</p>

<p>The princess demanded, &#8216;O my minister, why do you come here?&#8217;</p>

<p>Not that I would intimate to you that princesses are purchaseable.</p>

<p>Dang Wilapat bowed low And said, &#8220;Our greetings to thee, princess great.&#8221;</p>

<p>The princess had invited Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.</p>

<p>asked the princess, remembering first what had terrified her in the morning.</p>

<p>Adi bin Zayd and the Princess Hind, v. Ajib, The History of Gharib and his brother, vi.</p>

<p>When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what Natasha&#8217;s face had told her.</p>

<p>Down to 1802, however, he always had a mass ready for Princess Esterhazy&#8217;s name-day in September.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly, for a woman of ordinary rank is noticed -- and with still greater reason a princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am happy for your sake,&quot; said Princess Mary, who because of those tears quite forgave Natasha&#8217;s joy.</p>

<p>Between Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long existed rather curious relations.</p>

<p>At last, raising his eyes from his book, behold the princess, the nobles, and all the ton had disappeared.</p>

<p>Replied the Princess, &quot;By Allah, he hath dealt nobly in rebuilding it and hath done the deed of generous men!</p>

<p>Hildebd: If Gama bring the Princess here, Give him good cheer, give him good cheer.</p>

<p>Belli Ahmad said in his heart, &quot;Thy name is Belli Ahmad, and shalt thou not see this beautiful Princess Nighara?</p>

<p>But the princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it was to him that she now spoke.</p>

<p>Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Verily the Sultan and all the Lords of his land are in sore cark and care for the affair of his daughter, the Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quoth the Princess, &#8220;Show me that same&#8221;; and the old woman, &#8220;O apple of my eye, here it is, turn it over and examine it.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you like, I&#8217;ll make acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her belle-seur,&quot; added the princess, lifting her head haughtily.</p>

<p>In November the Princess arrived at Altana from Copenhagen, the reports circulated respecting her having compelled her husband to separate from her.</p>

<p>When I was born she transformed me into a boy, hoping that no one would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess of the Land of Oz.</p>

<p>did not disturb himself; he offered his hand to Madame without looking at Monsieur his brother, and led the young princess to the door of her apartments.</p>

<p>Then Princess Moonlight told the old man that if she was forced to go to the Palace in obedience to the Emperor&#8217;s order, she would vanish from the earth.</p>

<p>Whene&#8217;er the princess was annoyed, the King, With kisses and soft words would quiet her, And sing to her sweet songs till she became Herself again.</p>

<p>He saw when the princess fled from the battle, and Rinaldo being then engaged in a fight on foot, Bayard found himself free to follow the traces of Angelica.</p>

<p>During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a long time past.</p>

<p>I leapt to the window in time to have in view the little Princess Ottilia, followed by her faithful gaunt groom, before she was lost in the shadow of the fir-trees.</p>

<p>She was attached to the court of the Princess of Orange, daughter of Charles I., 1654, and contracted to James, Duke of York, at Breda, November 24th, 1659.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Madrid he found the princesse des Ursins all but omnipotent with the king, and for a time he judged it expedient to use her influence in carrying out his plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adieu, count,&#8221; said the chevalier, without seeming in any way to have noticed the count&#8217;s slight; &#8220;adieu, and bring us back a princess who will not talk with her own portrait too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Bock perceives my good-fortune--rushes forward--tears it from my hands, and, just fancy--presents it to the princess, and so cheated me of the honor I had so fortunately earned.</p>

<p>It was what she jeopardized--her state, her rank, her dignity as princess and daughter of an ancient House, things typical to her of sovereign duties, and the high seclusion of her name.</p>

<p>[FN#326] Moreover, O King, thou knowest that the Princess Jauharah, the daughter of our lord the King must needs be wedded and bedded, for the sage saith, a girl&#8217;s lot is either grace of marriage or the grave.</p>

<p>The queen and De Winter continued to converse for some time in low voices, in order that the young princess should not overhear them; but the precaution was needless: she was in deep converse with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...&#8220; &#8221;I understand why he&#8220; (Prince Andrew) &#8221;liked no one so much as him,&quot; said Princess Mary.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Intendant of the gardens and his wife brought up the two Princes and the Princess with all love and tenderness; and, as the children grew in years, their love for these adopted ones increased in like proportion.</p>

<p>(Enter the Princess) Mighty maiden with a mission-- Paragon of common sense; Running found of erudition-- Miracle of eloquence, of eloquence!</p>

<p>Here is my man of the world,&#8220; put in Papa, indicating Woloda; &#8221;and here is my poet,&quot; he added as I kissed the small, dry hand of the Princess, with a vivid picture in my mind of that same hand holding a rod and applying it vigorously.</p>

<p>All that was going on before her now seemed quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past.</p>

<p>The wind blew fair for them and they sailed on, without ceasing and with all diligence, till they reached the city of France and landing with the Princess Miriam carried her to her father, who received her, seated on the throne of his Kingship.</p>

<p>He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights.</p>

<p>While they carried off the youngest princess, the other two asked leave to say adieu to Prince Badialzaman They cried out from the top of the well, &quot;Prince have patience till Friday, when you will see six bulls pass by--three red ones and three black ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our hatred of the common enemy is sufficient bond to insure our loyalty to each other, and after we have defiled the Princess of Helium there will be still greater reason for the maintenance of our allegiance--unless I greatly mistake the temper of her lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>The incidents of the Magician and Aladdin at the Cave, and the conveying of the Princess and the vazÝr&#8217;s son three nights in succession to Aladdin&#8217;s house (which occurs, in modified forms, in other tales in The Nights), I consider as the work of the Arabian author.</p>

<p>Hark, slave, it is but this: The princess comes to hunt here in the park, And in her train there is a gentle lady; When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name, And Rosaline they call her: ask for her And to her white hand see thou do commend This seal&#8217;d-up counsel.</p>

<p>So the princess asked the magician, and he told her that in the wood was a hydra with seven heads; in the middle head of the hydra was a leveret, in the head of the leveret was a bird, in the bird&#8217;s head was a precious stone, and if this stone were put under his pillow he would die.</p>

<p>In the Norse tale of &#8220;the giant who had no heart in his body,&#8221; the giant tells the captive princess, &#8220;Far, far away in a lake lies an island, on that island stands a church, in that church is a well, in that well swims a duck, in that duck there is an egg, and in that egg there lies my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke of Suffolke is the first, and claimes To be high Steward; Next the Duke of Norfolke, He to be Earle Marshall: you may reade the rest 1 I thanke you Sir: Had I not known those customs, I should haue beene beholding to your Paper: But I beseech you, what&#8217;s become of Katherine The Princesse Dowager?</p>

<p>So definite a quest of her, with the bridge-party interrupted or altered for it, was an impression that fairly assailed the Princess, and to which something of attitude and aspect, of the air of arrested pursuit and purpose, in Charlotte, together with the suggestion of her next vague movements, quickly added its meaning.</p>

<p>But the Princess had her fancy at last about that too; she was in the midst of a passage, before she knew it, between Father Mitchell and Charlotte--some approach he would have attempted with her, that very morning perhaps, to the circumstance of an apparent detachment, recently noted in her, from any practice of devotion.</p>

<p>These words be ill words,&#8220; rejoined the Princess, &#8221;and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest.</p>

<p>Then he descended from the lofty gallery, His hand in the hand of the tall princess, And came to the door of the gold-painted pavilion, And entered that royal assembly, Which blazed with light like the bowers of Paradise; And the slaves stood like houris before them: And Zal gazed in astonishment On her face, and her hair, and her stately form, and on all that splendor.</p>

<p>And then he taught the King to charm the Queen In such-wise, that no man could see her more, Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm, Coming and going, and she lay as dead, And lost all use of life: but when the King Made proffer of the league of golden mines, The province with a hundred miles of coast, The palace and the princess, that old man Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass, And vanished, and his book came down to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>In short, Chopin was made much of; had to play four times, received an invitation to dine at the castle the following day, &amp;c., &amp;c. That our friend, in spite of all these charming prospects, leaving behind him three lovely princesses, and who knows what other aristocratic amenities, rolled off the very next morning at five o&#8217;clock in a vehicle hired at the low price of two thalers--i.e., six shillings--must be called either a feat of superhuman heroism or an instance of barbarous insensibility--let the reader decide which.</p>

<p>After this narration another bard came forward who recited a different story: &#8220;When Arthur bowed his haughty crest, No princess veiled in azure vest Snatched him, by Merlin&#8217;s powerful spell, In groves of golden bliss to dwell; But when he fell, with winged speed, His champions, on a milk-white steed, From the battle&#8217;s hurricane, Bore him to Joseph&#8217;s towered fane, In the fair vale of Avalon; There, with chanted orison And the long blaze of tapers clear, The stoled fathers met the bier; Through the dim aisles, in order dread Of martial woe, the chief they led, And deep entombed in holy ground, Before the altar&#8217;s solemn bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, on the contrary, never grow old; these four are precious stones, and these it is quite right to purchase.” When I had thus spoken, the Duchess showed some signs of irritation, and exclaimed: “I have a mind to possess these pearls; so, prithee, take them to the Duke, and praise them up to the skies; even if you have to use some words beyond the bounds of truth, speak them to do me service; it will be well for you!” I have always been the greatest friend of truth and foe of lies: yet compelled by necessity, unwilling to lose the favour of so great a princess, I took those confounded pearls sorely against my inclination, and went with them over to the other room, whither the Duke had withdrawn.</p>

<p>Hear, Lord, my prayer; let not my soul faint under Thy discipline, nor let me faint in confessing unto Thee all Thy mercies, whereby Thou hast drawn me out of all my most evil ways, that Thou mightest become a delight to me above all the allurements which I once pursued; that I may most entirely love Thee, and clasp Thy hand with all my affections, and Thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation, even unto the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter5chapter5a"><a id="chapter5">Chapter 5</a></h2>

<p>For the purpose of noticing how Chaucer arranges as well as tells a story, the following attempt at a condensed prose rendering of his narrative may be acceptable:-- Once upon a time in Flanders there was a company of young men, who gave themselves up to every kind of dissipation and debauchery--haunting the taverns where dancing and dicing continues day and night, eating and drinking, and serving the devil in his own temple by their outrageous life of luxury.</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course I do!</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>`Of course it is.</p>

<p>Of course you are.</p>

<p>Of course it will, sir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course--a strange man!</p>

<p>Of course he was a rotter.</p>

<p>Of course it&#8217;s very annoying.</p>

<p>Of course,&quot; Cordery answered.</p>

<p>Of course he roused suspicion.</p>

<p>Of course it may,&quot; said Angel.</p>

<p>Of course you was wrong in that.</p>

<p>Of course,&quot; replied the Glass Cat.</p>

<p>Of course my feelings were wounded.</p>

<p>Of course it must be done,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Of course,&#8220; said he, &#8221;yes, the elephant.</p>

<p>Of course I know it, and act accordingly.</p>

<p>Of course you must come here,&quot; said Athelny.</p>

<p>Of course, your trouble isn&#8217;t like mine was.</p>

<p>Of course we did,&quot; declared the friend stoutly.</p>

<p>Of course,&#8217; he said, &#8217;Julius is somewhat insane.</p>

<p>Of course I shall do no such thing as examine your luggage!</p>

<p>Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t do to say so to the children, you know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course he&#8217;s stuffed,&quot; replied Dorothy, who was still angry.</p>

<p>Of course, such a thing as that should have been kept from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course there is a limit to this physiological self-examination.</p>

<p>Of course he&#8217;s got a good house behind him, but that won&#8217;t do alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, sir,&#8221; said my father, &#8220;you have read Martinus Scriblerus?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course it is very bad for the horses, but then it is good for trade.</p>

<p>Of course it would; utter ruin; he never could hold up his head again.</p>

<p>Of course we are,&quot; he said, with the slightest modification of sharpness.</p>

<p>Of course the Senate, and not I, would decide whether to admit or reject him.</p>

<p>Of course, sir, I&#8217;ll be glad to know if you ever do light on a cause of any kind.</p>

<p>Of course, such gentlemen have no control over a horse, if anything happens suddenly.</p>

<p>Of course, it is our hope that this test will validate Rapid Dominance as a legitimate doctrine.</p>

<p>Of course, with a warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils, but we have not reached that stage yet.</p>

<p>Of course the children anthropomorphized--if that is the proper term-- their friends of the animal world.</p>

<p>Of course Eleanor made a thousand protestations, a uttered a thousand hopes that Madeline would enjoy herself.</p>

<p>Of course that&#8217;s all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you heard it,&#8221; said Honoria, coldly sweet, &#8220;since we have had no opportunity of inform- ing you ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course it signifies most distinctly that this history must not be judged by the canons of modern historical criticism.</p>

<p>Of course, it also shows that Peter is ever so old, but he is really always the same age, so that does not matter in the least.</p>

<p>(Of course all literature is necessarily based on the ordinary facts of life, which we may call by the more general name of Reality.)</p>

<p>Of course I want to know you, my dear,&quot; cried Mrs. Struthers in a round rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig.</p>

<p>Of course they were arranged--all four arranged; but what had the basis of their life been, precisely, but that they were arranged together?</p>

<p>Of course the most common source of clothing was the dead, and no body was carried out with any clothing on it that could be of service to the survivors.</p>

<p>Of course, in the future society there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another significance, rational and in harmony with her environment.</p>

<p>Of course, you are not to go out of the room as if you meant it and did it on purpose, but as if it was quite an accident, and to come back again in the same way.</p>

<p>Of course there is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in Christ, seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life.</p>

<p>Of course I was all ready, and others of our set were going home by the same conveyance, viz., Rucker, Ord, A. J. Smith--some under orders, and the others on leave.</p>

<p>Of course they bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.</p>

<p>Of course, there is room here, particularly where the majority happens to be Irish, for a vast quantity of frothy bluster about drilled and intimidated voters, and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Of course,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I think Gerald spoke to Rupert so that it shouldn&#8217;t seem like an outing with a TYPE--&#8217; &#8216;I know, of course,&#8217; said Gudrun, &#8216;that he quite commonly does take up with that sort.&#8217;</p>

<p>Of course there was no path, and after some perplexity amongst rocks and ravines, we reached the upper limit of wood, and halted by some bleached juniper-trees, which were soon converted into blazing fires.</p>

<p>Of course I consented to receive the visitor, and with the mercury at 84 degrees, five men, two boys, and five women entered my small, low room, and after bowing to the earth three times, sat down on the floor.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t know what Miss Lavendar used to look like but I don&#8217;t fancy somehow that she has changed a great deal,&quot; said Anne, after she had helped Davy to maple syrup, giving him two spoonfuls to pacify him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he is right there,&#8221; said Countess Mary, &#8220;but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us, duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, petty quarrels go their course, in the lanes as elsewhere; but groupings in accordance with personal affinities grow up, and within their circle mutual aid is practised to an extent of which the richer classes have no idea.</p>

<p>Of course nothing can ever prevent accidents caused by human weakness or misconduct; and there should be drastic punishment for any railroad employee, whether officer or man, who by issuance of wrong orders or by disobedience of orders causes disaster.</p>

<p>Of course I could not deny the fact, and had to submit to all its painful consequences for months; and, moreover, I could not hide from myself that many of the officers and soldiers subsequently placed under my command looked at me askance and with suspicion.</p>

<p>Of course, all crimes are not crimes against property, though such are the crimes that the English law, valuing what a man has more than what a man is, punishes with the harshest and most horrible severity, if we except the crime of murder, and regard death as worse than penal servitude, a point on which our criminals, I believe, disagree.</p>

<p>Of course, Moncharmin, especially after the money had been restored, continued to believe that he had, for a short while, been the butt of Richard&#8217;s sense of humor, whereas Richard, on his side, was convinced that Moncharmin had amused himself by inventing the whole of the affair of the Opera ghost, in order to revenge himself for a few jokes.</p>

<p>Had they risked the dangerous alternative, it might have ensured the triumph of the whole enterprise, while their actual decision proved most disastrous in the end.</p>

<p>At the expiration of this period, she said to her father: &quot;I recollect that once upon a time thou didst cast into yonder pit a man that had fetched thy rod from the garden for thee, and thou didst commit a great trespass thereby.</p>

<p>I quitted his side on Friday, but on Saturday I went to him, and found him very weak.</p>

<p>Ona&#8217;s confinement lost her only a week&#8217;s wages--she would go to the factory the second Monday, and the best that Jurgis could persuade her was to ride in the car, and let him run along behind and help her to Brown&#8217;s when she alighted.</p>

<p>A few, weak in faith, or carried away by sudden passion, a burst of despair, subscribe to the required oath, assist as demanded at the religious services on Sunday, suddenly rise to distinction, are sure of preserving their wealth, or even enter into sole possession of the family property, to the exclusion of all its other members.</p>

<p>While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never have understood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she herself would lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said, &#8220;How you can go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn&#8217;t Sunday, you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week -- once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields -- and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village.</p>

<p>From year&#8217;s end to year&#8217;s end he never took one of these volumes from the shelf; but there was no member of the family that would dare for his life to touch one of the books, except upon those rare Sunday evenings when there was no dinner-party, and when the great scarlet Bible and Prayer-book were taken out from the corner where they stood beside his copy of the Peerage, and the servants being rung up to the dining parlour, Osborne read the evening service to his family in a loud grating pompous voice.</p>

<p>It is surmised by the biographers that the young Shakespeare got his vast knowledge of the law and his familiar and accurate acquaintance with the manners and customs and shop-talk of lawyers through being for a time the CLERK OF A STRATFORD COURT; just as a bright lad like me, reared in a village on the banks of the Mississippi, might become perfect in knowledge of the Behring Strait whale-fishery and the shop-talk of the veteran exercisers of that adventure-bristling trade through catching catfish with a &#8220;trot-line&#8221; Sundays.</p>

<p>But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d&#8217;ye see?</p>

<p>(The violins begin to play.)</p>

<p>up against the window, with a violin.</p>

<p>The fever of ill-luck had seized the violin.</p>

<p>Recreation: Fond of Doyle&#8217;s works and the violin.</p>

<p>He is to be the violin on which the master is to play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He got blood poisoning and lost one finger, and couldn&#8217;t play the violin any more; and then he went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened it with some trepidation, and it was found to contain a Cremona violin --a genuine Stradivarius.</p>

<p>The orchestra was composed of Beck on the violin, Sundbeck on the mandolin, and the undersigned on the flute.</p>

<p>The comparatively ineffective treatment of the violin and violoncello also lays the composer open to censure.</p>

<p>I can,&quot; promptly replied young George (afterwards Sir George) Smart, who was sitting among the violinists.</p>

<p>The orchestra consisted in part of amateurs, who were most numerous among the violins, tenors, and violoncellos.</p>

<p>Of musical instruments we had a piano, a violin, a flute, mandolins, not forgetting a mouth-organ and an accordion.</p>

<p>As Chopin&#8217;s playing was equally sympathetic to Slavik, they formed the project of writing a duet for violin and piano.</p>

<p>Violin Studies Haydn&#8217;s chief instrument was the clavier, but in addition to that he diligently practiced the violin.</p>

<p>There, snuff and cigars, and German pipes and flutes, and violins and violoncellos, divide the supremacy between them.</p>

<p>He was a good violinist, and played the organ so well that he was soon able to act as deputy-organist at the cathedral.</p>

<p>Theresa Milanolla played the violin with such skill that many people thought that she must have played before her birth.</p>

<p>The Epicureans did not perceive that the head of the school had left them; the violins continued playing all night long.</p>

<p>He maintained that the father was the first violinist in the world and that the daughter had the making of a great artist.</p>

<p>(J. F.-K.) ALARD, JEAN DELPHIN (1815-1888), French violinist and teacher, was born at Bayonne on the 8th of May 1815.</p>

<p>I was at their church, where I was entertain&#8217;d with good musick, the organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets, etc.</p>

<p>Not so bad a place, after all,&quot; mumbled Peter, as he warmed himself at the fire and the flask; then, taking out his violin, he began to play.</p>

<p>When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.</p>

<p>Though nobody took very much notice of what he was doing, he still continued each day to plant apple seeds and each evening to play on his violin.</p>

<p>The violinist played a tune and the pianiste began hammering the first figure of a quadrille on the piano, to the tune of a most merry Russian song.</p>

<p>They were instructed in &#8220;religion and Latin, together with the ordinary subjects of school education, and in music, the violin, clavier, and singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chapter V The Enchanted Violin Christine Daae, owing to intrigues to which I will return later, did not immediately continue her triumph at the Opera.</p>

<p>A violin and mandolin orchestra, composed of Prestrud, Sundbeck, and Beck, contributed several pieces, and our excellent gramophone was heard for the first time.</p>

<p>Among the musicians who had been engaged for the Esterhazy service in 1779 were a couple named Polzelli--the husband a violinist, the wife a second-rate vocalist.</p>

<p>His playing was full of fire and point, and his compositions had a great success in France, while his violin school had a wider vogue and considerably greater value.</p>

<p>His shoulders were broad and strong, and though his limbs were hid by his cassock, his arms showed almost huge, and the violin lay tucked under his chin like a mere toy.</p>

<p>When at last a soft sorrow crept across the violins, there came to him the vision of a far-off home, the great eyes of his sister, and the dark drawn face of his mother.</p>

<p>He sat beside her on the couch and behaved very well until the Polish violin-teacher across the hall began to practise, when Prince would growl and sniff the air with disgust.</p>

<p>He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,--his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Galician violinist, zig-zagging extreme extensions and contractions of his corporeal frame in execution, and described by Colney as &#8216;Paganini on wall,&#8217; failed to supplant Durandarte in Nesta&#8217;s memory.</p>

<p>the nativs requested the party to dance which they very readily consented and Peter Cruzat played on the Violin and the men danced Several dances &amp; retired to rest in the houses of the 1st and Second Cheif.</p>

<p>The second violin is a Slovak, a tall, gaunt man with black- rimmed spectacles and the mute and patient look of an overdriven mule; he responds to the whip but feebly, and then always falls back into his old rut.</p>

<p>Having already been encouraged by the rector in Grottkau to cultivate his beautiful voice, he became in Breslau a chorister in one of the churches, and after some time was often employed as violinist and singer at the theatre.</p>

<p>The CAPTAIN then proceeds as follows, his song being accompanied by a violin, generally played by the BESSY - Six actors I have brought Who were ne&#8217;er on a stage before; But they will do their best, And they can do no more.</p>

<p>Among the members of the Polish band--which consisted of a leader (Premier), four violins, one oboe, two French horns, three bassoons, and one double bass--we meet with such well-known men as Johann Joachim Quanz and Franz Benda.</p>

<p>He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the first violin: &quot;Semen!</p>

<p>But then I heard that my father had borrowed money from the one who came first, and that his violin came from that man; and my father told me the violin would be taken from him, and he would have to go to prison, if I did not marry that man.</p>

<p>Also it was Saturday night, and in a couple of hours would come a violin and a cornet, and in the rear part of the saloon the families of the neighborhood would dance and feast upon wienerwurst and lager, until two or three o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>

<p>So long as down the rocking floor The raving polka spins, So long as Kitchen Lancers spur The maddened violins, So long as through the whirling smoke We hear the oft-told tale-- &#8220;Twelve hundred in the Lotteries,&#8221; And Whatshername for sale?</p>

<p>Merk began his musical career as a violinist, but being badly bitten in the arm by a big dog, and disabled thereby to hold the violin in its proper position (this is what Fetis relates), he devoted himself to the violoncello, and with such success as to become the first solo player in Vienna.</p>

<p>It may be compared, or rather contrasted, with another poem on the same subject which voices the despair in the heart of the French poet Verlaine, who hears &#8220;the sobbing of the violins of autumn&#8221;: Les sanglots longs Des violons De l&#8217;automne Blessent mon coeur D&#8217;une langueur Monotone.</p>

<p>Here another of the party introduces his companions by singing to a violin accompaniment, as follows: Here&#8217;s two or three jolly boys, all in one mind; We&#8217;ve come a pace-egging, {44} I hope you&#8217;ll prove kind: I hope you&#8217;ll prove kind with your money and beer, We shall come no more near you until the next year.</p>

<p>The concert- giver, a clever pianist and composer, who enjoyed in his day a good reputation in Germany, Russia, and Poland, produced at every matinee a new pianoforte concerto by one of the best composers-- sometimes one of his own--and was assisted by the quartet party of Bielawski, a good violinist, leader in the orchestra, and professor at the Conservatorium.</p>

<p>The activity of the society was great, and must have been beneficial; for we read that they had every Sunday performances of quartets and other kinds of chamber music, that ladies frequently came forward with pianoforte sonatas, and that when the celebrated violinist Moser, of Berlin, visited Warsaw, he made them acquainted with the finest quartets of Mozart and Haydn.</p>

<p>From gay guitar and violin the silver notes are flowing, And the lovely lute doth speak between the trumpet&#8217;s lordly blowing, And banners bright from lattice light are waving everywhere, And the tall, tall plume of our cousin&#8217;s bridegroom floats proudly in the air: Rise up, rise up, Xarifa, lay the golden cushion down; Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the town.</p>

<p>And it had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight.</p>

<p>Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it--and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley--the little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain.</p>

<p>After dinner took coach and to my wife, who was gone before into the Strand, there to buy a nightgown, where I found her in a shop with her pretty girle, and having bought it away home, and I thence to Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s again, and so took coach alone, it now being almost night, to White Hall, and there in the Boarded- gallery did hear the musick with which the King is presented this night by Monsieur Grebus, the master of his musick; both instrumentall--I think twenty-four violins--and vocall; an English song upon Peace.</p>

<p>She remembered how she--wearing her low necked silk dress stained with wine, a red bow in her untidy hair, wearied, weak, half tipsy, having seen her visitors off, sat down during an interval in the dancing by the piano beside the bony pianiste with the blotchy face, who played the accompaniments to the violin, and began complaining of her hard fate; and how this pianiste said that she, too, was feeling how heavy her position was and would like to change it; and how Clara suddenly came up to them; and how they all three decided to change their life.</p>

<p>I vividly recollect the time, the place, the persons, and even the temperature of the air, while the lively idea of a certain local impression peculiar to those times, transports me back again to the very spot; for example, all that was repeated at our meetings, all that was sung in the choir, everything that passed there; the beautiful and noble habits of the canons, the chasubles of the priests, the mitres of the singers, the persons of the musicians; an old lame carpenter who played the counter-bass, a little fair abbe who performed on the violin, the ragged cassock which M. le Maitre, after taking off his sword, used to put over his secular habit, and the fine surplice with which he covered the rags of the former, when he went to the choir; the pride with which I held my little flute to my lips, and seated myself in the orchestra, to assist in a recitative which M. le Maitre had composed on purpose for me; the good dinner that afterwards awaited us, and the good appetites we carried to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you will always be with me to the end.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter8chapter8a"><a id="chapter8">Chapter 8</a></h2>

<p>`Once upon a time there were three little sisters,&#8217; the Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--&#8217; `What did they live on?&#8217;</p>

<p>G. Little witch!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the Witch of the North.&#8221;</p>

<p>[Illustration: THE WITCHES&#8217; SABBATH.]</p>

<p>Those witch underlids were working brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blue is the color of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color.</p>

<p>Each wanted it as the stronghold of their witchcraft, their magic.</p>

<p>Yes; a wicked witch enchanted her, so she could not rule her kingdom.</p>

<p>[FN#366] Suspecting her to be a witch because she was old and poor.</p>

<p>Some sorcerer, some witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiend-like enough.</p>

<p>It is all done,&#8217; said he, &#8217;and the witch is already hanging on the gallows.</p>

<p>I thought I was tired of her--I was under odd influences--witchcraft, it seems.</p>

<p>And now we can swear that where the dear witch is will Morris, my Scotsman, be found.</p>

<p>And now the incantation seemed complete, for the Witch stood upright and cried the one word &#8220;Yeowa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Childe Wynd ordered the ship to be put about, and the witch-queen thought he had given up the attempt.</p>

<p>The Swart ones meet the Woodland Spirits, and the pestilent phantoms strive to share the path with the Witches.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s yon flaysome, graceless quean, that&#8217;s witched our lad, wi&#8217; her bold een and her forrard ways - till - Nay!</p>

<p>Thus was the name of the great god taken from him, and Isis, the witch, spake, &quot;Flow away, poison, depart from Ra.</p>

<p>(75) Accordingly, when the figure of Samuel stood upright before them, the witch knew that the king was with her.</p>

<p>Poison&quot; like these hell-broths are part of the Witch or Obi stock-in-trade, and Frode uses powdered gold as an antidote.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, at that time,&#8221; said the Wizard, thoughtfully, &#8220;there were two Good Witches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East?</p>

<p>The people believed that on that evening and night the witches were abroad and busy casting spells on cattle and stealing cows&#8217; milk.</p>

<p>That woman, who is a Witch of Satan&#8217;s breed, hath disclosed to thy father all he sought to learn concerning this our dwelling-place.</p>

<p>The appearance of witches in the guise of birds was no unusual thing, indeed, and a farmer named Blakesley shot one of them in that form.</p>

<p>Why go too then: Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake, He thought &#8217;twas Witchcraft.</p>

<p>It is for this reason solely that the witchcraft episode assumes historical importance, instead of being a side-scene of ghastly picturesqueness.</p>

<p>The Winged Monkeys You will remember there was no road--not even a pathway-- between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City.</p>

<p>A witch like Circe dost thou seem; For Circe could o&#8217;ercloud the sky; Oh, let the sun appear once more, And bid the clouds of darkness fly!</p>

<p>Many young, and even old men, hearing of this (our chief&#8217;s) offer, have traveled many miles to try their arrows on the witches, but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>The noises recurred in 1888, when houses rattled in witch-haunted Salem, eight miles away, and the bell on the village church &#8220;sung like a tuning-fork.&#8221;</p>

<p>The witchery of the dawn turned the grey river-reaches to purple, gold, and opal; and it was as though the lumbering dhoni crept across the splendors of a new heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she said, and her face was set hard with cold and excitement, so that she looked a witch in the uproar; &#8220;would you not say the devil is loose now Angelo is abroad?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hereat the Witch again louted low and kissed the carpet under Peri-Banu&#8217;s feet, and took leave of her hostess in goodly phrase and with great show of gratitude for her favours.</p>

<p>They think that the St. John&#8217;s fire keeps witches from the cattle, and they say that he who does not come to it will have his barley full of thistles and his oats full of weeds.</p>

<p>[FN#430] The enchanted pitcher does duty here for the witches&#8217; broomstick and the fairies&#8217; rush of European tales, but a similar conveyance is, I think, not unknown to Western folk-lore.</p>

<p>[Illustration: HAWTHORNES BIRTHPLACE, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS] John Hathorne, a son of the first settler, was a judge of the poor creatures who were put to death as witches at Salem in 1692.</p>

<p>The witch-doctors of the North made their camp on the northern rim of the island; those from the South settled along the southern edge, looking towards what is now the great city of Vancouver.</p>

<p>As this creature is reckoned in our country a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play their pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted; and, in a violent fright, shrank under the bedclothes.</p>

<p>Because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that was beautiful and agreeable, and that made use of witchcraft, that sold nations through her fornications, and families through her witchcrafts.</p>

<p>Of course old Mombi had no intention of being found by Glinda; so, while her enemies were marching up the street, the witch transformed herself into a red rose growing upon a bush in the garden of the palace.</p>

<p>Naturally enough the people who continued to burn his image came in time to identify it as the effigy of persons, whom, on various grounds, they regarded with aversion, such as Judas Iscariot, Luther, and a witch.</p>

<p>So away home again, and there to my office to write my letters very late, and then home to supper, and then to read the late printed discourse of witches by a member of Gresham College,--[For belief in witches.</p>

<p>BLOOM: (MURMURS WITH HANGDOG MEEKNESS GLUM) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may ... BEAUFOY: (HIS LIP UPCURLED, SMILES SUPERCILIOUSLY ON THE COURT) You funny ass, you!</p>

<p>While his sorrow-stricken mother was bewailing his loss, and the rest of us were lamenting with her, the witches suddenly commenced to screech so loud that you would have thought a hare was being run down by the hounds!</p>

<p>[FN#264] Blue eyes have a bad name in Arabia as in India: the witch Zarká of Al-Yamamah was noted for them; and &#8220;blue eyed&#8221; often means &#8220;fierce-eyed,&#8221; alluding to the Greeks and Daylamites, mortal-enemies to Ishmael.</p>

<p>They mark him out as a lower kind of Saint Dominic, differing from the fierce and gloomy enthusiast who founded the Inquisition, as we might imagine the familiar imp of a spiteful witch to differ from an archangel of darkness.</p>

<p>The spell of the enchanted forest is broken when the crowd invades its solitude; the witchery of moonlight fades into the light of common day; and then comes Theseus with his dogs to drive not the foxes but the fairies out of the landscape.</p>

<p>In some districts they crown or gird themselves with mugwort while the midsummer fire is burning, for this is supposed to be a protection against ghosts, witches, and sickness; in particular, a wreath of mugwort is a sure preventive of sore eyes.</p>

<p>In his multifarious reading he had become acquainted with all existing traditions and speculations concerning witchcraft, and his profession as minister in the Calvinist communion predisposed him to investigate all accessible details concerning the devil.</p>

<p>The soldier first requires to be taken out of the well, and next the destruction of the old witch, after which he helps himself to the treasures in the hag&#8217;s cottage, and goes off to the nearest town, where he puts up at the best inn and gets himself fine clothes.</p>

<p>And this was the tribute paid by the American public to the master who had given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of witchery and mystery as &#8220;The Fall of the House of Usher&#8221; and &#8220;Ligea; such fascinating hoaxes as &#8221;The Unparalleled Adventure of Hans Pfaall,&#8220; &#8221;MSS.</p>

<p>LXXVII She had prepared the genial, fruitful bed, Under a broad pavilion; one more rich, Adorned, and jocund, never overhead (Did this for peace or war its master pitch) Was in the world, before or after, spread; And this from Thracian strand had borne the witch.</p>

<p>I can quite understand that were &#8216;Macbeth&#8217; produced for the first time before a modern London audience, many of the people present would strongly and vigorously object to the introduction of the witches in the first act, with their grotesque phrases and their ridiculous words.</p>

<p>Faith stay heere this night, they will surely do vs no harme: you saw they speake vs faire, giue vs gold: me thinkes they are such a gentle Nation, that but for the Mountaine of mad flesh that claimes mariage of me, I could finde in my heart to stay heere still, and turne Witch Ant.</p>

<p>XXXIX &quot;Me my wife&#8217;s words like poisoned weapon thrill, And pierce my suffering spirit through and through: Through bones and veins there went a deadly chill; My tongue clave to my throat: The witch withdrew With that the magic mantle, and at will Transformed me to mine ancient shape anew.</p>

<p>While Jones was admiring these things, and Partridge sat trembling with the firm belief that he was in the house of a witch, the old woman said, &#8220;I hope, gentlemen, you will make what haste you can; for I expect my master presently, and I would not for double the money he should find you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>To suckle these &#8220;familiars&#8221; with the blood of a witch was forbidden in English law, which ranked it as a felony; but they were thus nourished in secret, and by their aid the witch might raise storms, blight crops, abort births, lame cattle, topple over houses, and cause pains, convulsions, and illness.</p>

<p>The Ministers and Grandees now understood that the King was overwhelmed with woe, tearful-eyed and heavy-hearted by reason of the loss of Prince Ahmad; whereupon bethought the Grand Wazir of a certain witch famed for the Black Art who could conjure down the stars from heaven; and who was a noted dweller in the capital.</p>

<p>This latter view is strongly supported by the testimony of the people who celebrate the fire-festivals, since a popular name for the custom of kindling the fires is &#8220;burning the witches,&#8221; effigies of witches are sometimes consumed in the flames, and the fires, their embers, or their ashes are supposed to furnish protection against witchcraft.</p>

<p>I thought at first that she was a Gypsy, and addressing myself to her, inquired in Gitano if she were of that race; she understood me, but shaking her head, replied, that she was something better than a Gitana, and could speak something better than that jargon of witches; whereupon she commenced asking me several questions in exceedingly good Latin.</p>

<p>I was myself once one of those; and if I heard talk of dead folks walking, of prophecies, enchantments, witchcrafts, or any other story I had no mind to believe: &#8220;Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas, Nocturnos lemures, portentaque Thessala,&#8221; [&#8220;Dreams, magic terrors, marvels, sorceries, Thessalian prodigies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upfloated night, and darkened earth and air; Then feasted they before that cliff-like wall, Ceteian men and Trojans: babel of talk Rose from the feasters: all around the glow Of blazing campfires lighted up the tents: Pealed out the pipe&#8217;s sweet voice, and hautboys rang With their clear-shrilling reeds; the witching strain Of lyres was rippling round.</p>

<p>Seeks the mother to detain him, Thus the anxious mother answers: &quot;Do not go, my son beloved, Ignorant of Pohya-witchcraft, To the distant homes of Northland Till thou hast the art of magic, Till thou hast some little wisdom Do not go to fields of battle, To the fires of Northland&#8217;s children, To the slaughter-fields of Lapland, Till of magic thou art master.</p>

<p>As these sibyls thrust forth their grey heads, imperfectly covered with close caps of flannel, and showed their shrivelled brows, and long skinny arms, with various gestures, shrugs, and muttered expressions in Gaelic addressed to each other, my imagination recurred to the witches of Macbeth, and I imagined I read in the features of these crones the malevolence of the weird sisters.</p>

<p>Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep, When I recall to mind those once lov&#8217;d names, Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop, With Traversaro&#8217;s house and Anastagio s, (Each race disherited) and beside these, The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease, That witch&#8217;d us into love and courtesy; Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.</p>

<p>Before those cruel Twins, whom at one birth Incestuous Change bore to her father Time, _50 Error and Truth, had hunted from the Earth All those bright natures which adorned its prime, And left us nothing to believe in, worth The pains of putting into learned rhyme, A lady-witch there lived on Atlas&#8217; mountain _55 Within a cavern, by a secret fountain.</p>

<p>Then, as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination,--the moan of the whip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that harbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost.</p>

<p>They lived in a cave or cell, made out of a rock; it was divided into several apartments, one of which Prospero called his study; there he kept his books, which chiefly treated of magic, a study at that time much affected by all learned men: and the knowledge of this art he found very useful to him; for being thrown by a strange chance upon this island, which had been enchanted by a witch called Sycorax, who died there a short time before his arrival, Prospero, by virtue of his art, released many good spirits that Sycorax had imprisoned in the bodies of large trees, because they had refused to execute her wicked commands.</p>

<p>p. 1 - 590, the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter9chapter9a"><a id="chapter9">Chapter 9</a></h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s a fable I draw from a Naturalist&#8217;s book, and we&#8217;ll set it against the dicta of Jenny Do-nothing, Jenny Discretion, Jenny Wait-for- the-Gods: Once upon a time in a tropical island a man lay sick; so ill that he could not rise to trouble his neighbours for help; so weak that it was lifting a mountain to get up from his bed; so hopeless of succour that the last spark of distraught wisdom perching on his brains advised him to lie where he was and trouble not himself, since peace at least he could command, before he passed upon the black highroad men call our kingdom of peace: ay, he lay there.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll go back now.</p>

<p>We naturally ask why.</p>

<p>We always call it yours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve left the women behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>We reached the port.--Alas!</p>

<p>We are the flower, Thou the sun!</p>

<p>We still say &#8220;with might and main.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have a very formidable adversary.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>We move into the Hall after Christmas.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>We tread the path where Fate hath led, i.</p>

<p>We closed this year with sad forebodings.</p>

<p>We will descend, and fold him in our armes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have led such a solitary life--no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>We are all weak creeturs,&#8217; said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>We dressed hurriedly and ran to the upper deck.</p>

<p>We might as well do it as sit here doing nothing.</p>

<p>We can&#8217;t talk here,&quot; she said, stepping back a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go back to Paris, father, I feel entirely well.&#8221;</p>

<p>We are trustees and responsible stewards in the spending.</p>

<p>We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it.</p>

<p>We locked both doors, and saw poor Nan, as I thought, (but, oh!</p>

<p>We are going to be married soon,&quot; said Clare, with improvised phlegm.</p>

<p>We shall find them in the town And we&#8217;ll take them in and comfort them.</p>

<p>We had less than a thousand men as escort, and never thought of danger.</p>

<p>We seldom study the condition of the Negro to-day hon- estly and carefully.</p>

<p>We agree with Lord Mahon in thinking highly of the Whigs of Queen Anne&#8217;s reign.</p>

<p>We may easily bring it to the simplest of all possible forms, a pure despotism.</p>

<p>We have probably nothing equal to it in the present quiet operations of nature.</p>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones that have responded.</p>

<p>We arrived here on Sunday, the 1st of August, and both parties left again on the 4th.</p>

<p>We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>We despair of all other assistance or device, and we have recourse only to our hope in Thee.</p>

<p>We entertain a like notion with regard to the simplicity of substances, and from like causes.</p>

<p>We couldn&#8217;t enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds.</p>

<p>We want more drags, or with the next ebb the body may be lost for days in this infernal water.&#8217;</p>

<p>We took with us the Stele of lapis lazuli, whose graven record was coloured with vermilion pigment.</p>

<p>We have heard of an old German officer, who was a great admirer of correctness in military operations.</p>

<p>We took two or three hours together, by arrangement; it WAS on the eve of my marriage--at the moment you say.</p>

<p>We likewise possess two very singular fragments of the private correspondence of the senators on this occasion.</p>

<p>We had good organization, good men, but no cohesion, no real discipline, no respect for authority, no real knowledge of war.</p>

<p>We did so, promptly, and as nearly every man in camp was included, we fell in as for other purposes, by hundreds and thousands.</p>

<p>We got out in that direction about twenty miles, passed near a hill I named Mount Scott*, and found a small creek, but no water.</p>

<p>We rode in by the same way as we had come out the evening before, all four of us-- the men and the horses--wearied and jaded.</p>

<p>We can not embarrass or cut off the trade of France without at the same time in some degree embarrassing or cutting off our own trade.</p>

<p>We must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law-abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime.</p>

<p>We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill.</p>

<p>We lifted Mr. Trelawny on to the sofa where he had lain yesterday; and, having done what we could for him, turned our attention to the Nurse.</p>

<p>We have but one way to avoid them--that of acknowledging a common head of our church, whose word on all points of doctrine shall be authoritative.</p>

<p>We have his associate&#8217;s testimony that Tacitus made a most eloquent and dignified reply to the arguments which were urged on the part of the defence.</p>

<p>We had turned off the road, and were making our way up the hill, when, looking in the direction of Holdernesse Hall, I saw a cyclist coming swiftly along.</p>

<p>We were, as I was later to learn, nearing the edge of one of Mars&#8217; long-dead seas, in the bottom of which my encounter with the Martians had taken place.</p>

<p>We yield ourselves to your absolute will and pleasure, in order to save the remainder of the inhabitants of Calais, who have suffered much distress and misery.</p>

<p>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity.</p>

<p>We had no other law than a kind of moderated passion; no other civil power than an honest mob; and no other protection than the temporary attachment of one man to another.</p>

<p>We fled from him right and left and he saw us not, for his sight was altogether blent; but we were in terrible fear of him and made sure we were dead men despairing of escape.</p>

<p>* [We collected seven men&#8217;s loads of this superb plant for the Royal Gardens at Kew; but owing to unavoidable accidents and difficulties, few specimens reached England alive.</p>

<p>We seek to establish those material conditions of life in which, without exception, men may live in dignity, perform useful work, serve their communities, and worship God as they see fit.</p>

<p>We were extremely fortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships and privations, we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured.</p>

<p>We see, too, why Temple dwelt so much on the private wealth of the members, why he instituted a comparison between their united incomes and the united incomes of the members of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>We, too, rely on his goodness, on his goodness as manifested, not in extraordinary interpositions, but in those general laws which it has pleased him to establish in the physical and in the moral world.</p>

<p>We once found a tree in a village, with many pieces of the bark chipped off, closely allied to the Tangena or Tanghina, the ordeal poison tree of Madagascar; but we could not ascertain any particulars about it.</p>

<p>We have said that Mr Closerstil was accompanied by a learned friend of his, one Mr Romer, a barrister, who was greatly interested in Sir Roger, and who, being a strong Liberal, was assisting in the canvass with much energy.</p>

<p>We see from the foregoing how much the objective nature of War makes it a calculation of probabilities; now there is only one single element still wanting to make it a game, and that element it certainly is not without: it is chance.</p>

<p>We hear our bloody cousins are bestow&#8217;d In England and in Ireland; not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention: but of that to-morrow; When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly.</p>

<p>We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O our brother, O Hasan,&quot; replied they and binding chin-veils, armed themselves and slung on their swords: after which they brought Hasan a steed of the best and equipped him in panoply and weaponed him with goodly weapons.</p>

<p>We should avail ourselves of the present lull to secure the strategical points that will give us an advantage in the future military movements, and we should treat the idea of civil government as one in which we as a nation have a minor or subordinate interest.</p>

<p>We are glad to help in any movement for international peace, but this is because we sincerely believe that it is our duty to help all such movements provided they are sane and rational, and not because there is any tendency toward militarism on our part which needs to be cured.</p>

<p>We could not understand this erection of fortifications on that side, because, knowing as we did how well the flanks of the City were protected by the Savannah and Ogeeche Rivers, we could not see how a force from the coast--whence we supposed an attack must come, could hope to reach the City&#8217;s rear, especially as we had just come up on the right flank of the City, and saw no sign of our folks in that direction.</p>

<p>Her soul went out to the Unseen Pity that would be with her to the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter10chapter10a"><a id="chapter10">Chapter 10</a></h2>

<p>Once upon a time I taught school in the hills of Tennessee, where the broad dark vale of the Mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>If she is with you his way will be clear.</p>

<p>If Charlotte doesn&#8217;t understand me, it is that I&#8217;ve prevented her.</p>

<p>If she declines my proposal again, I will accept her word as final.</p>

<p>If you moved the pillow a black beetle would run from under it....</p>

<p>If you ask me,&#8220; said Tommy, &#8221;we&#8217;re all too damned businesslike nowadays.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is a signal, whoever it may be who has made it, he will renew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Mas&#8217;r pleases,&#8220; said Tom, &#8221;Miss Eva used to read this so beautifully.</p>

<p>If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse, As he will have me, how am I so poor?</p>

<p>If there be such a dart in princes&#8217; frowns, How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?</p>

<p>If thus thou vanishest, thou tell&#8217;st the world, It is not worth leaue-taking Char.</p>

<p>If you prefer going alone, only say the word and you&#8217;ll find that we shan&#8217;t trouble you.&#8217;</p>

<p>If, after this, you took the graceless lad, Could you complain, my friend, he proved so bad?</p>

<p>If I had poor luck with Bass&#8217;s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.</p>

<p>If I want to know exactly how the country stands, I turn to the Money Article in the papers.</p>

<p>If any revolt from the King, they shall be the enemies of the Lacedaemonians and their allies.</p>

<p>If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge.</p>

<p>If he did not let it grow again I think I should no longer love him; he looks so horrid like this.</p>

<p>If she, thus drawn, incline toward it, love is that inclining, And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.</p>

<p>If you received this etext on a physical medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.</p>

<p>If our free enterprise economy is to be strong and healthy, we must reinvigorate the forces of competition.</p>

<p>If a botanist found this state of things in a new plant, I imagine he might be inclined to think that his tree was monoecious, that the flowers were of different sexes, and that, so far from setting up a barrier between the branches of the tree, the only hope of fertility lay in bringing them together.</p>

<p>If this newes be true, Poore Queene, and Sonne, your labour is but lost: For Warwicke is a subtle Orator: And Lewis a Prince soone wonne with mouing words: By this account then, Margaret may winne him, For she&#8217;s a woman to be pittied much: Her sighes will make a batt&#8217;ry in his brest, Her teares will pierce into a Marble heart: The Tyger will be milde, whiles she doth mourne; And Nero will be tainted with remorse, To heare and see her plaints, her Brinish Teares.</p>

<p>If what we call evil and torment is neither evil nor torment of itself, but only that our fancy gives it that quality, it is in us to change it, and it being in our own choice, if there be no constraint upon us, we must certainly be very strange fools to take arms for that side which is most offensive to us, and to give sickness, want, and contempt a bitter and nauseous taste, if it be in our power to give them a pleasant relish, and if, fortune simply providing the matter, &#8217;tis for us to give it the form.</p>

<p>If the colony continues increasing, it will become necessary to augment the number of the representatives, and that the interest of every part of the colony may be attended to, it will be found best to divide the whole into convenient parts, each part sending its proper number; and that the ELECTED might never form to themselves an interest separate from the ELECTORS, prudence will point out the propriety of having elections often; because as the ELECTED might by that means return and mix again with the general body of the ELECTORS in a few months, their fidelity to the public will be secured by the prudent reflection of not making a rod for themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;you are as hearty as a three-hundred-year-old oak.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three-year-old grew too ambitious in his fierceness.</p>

<p>for I addressed them as I would a group of ten-year-old boys.</p>

<p>Hold the horse, Willy,&quot; said Mrs. Moss to the twelve-year-old boy.</p>

<p>Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old nephew.</p>

<p>The house had an air of colonial self-respect that impressed even a nine-year-old child.</p>

<p>To them a son was born named Rustem, who, when one day old, was as large as a year-old child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear aunt, some of them appear old and others ugly, thanks to their ten-year-old fashions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now he was not even the same as when she had left him; he was still further from the four-year-old baby, more grown and thinner.</p>

<p>He had fixed his eyes admiringly on a coal-black, four-year-old mare, a mere colt, which brought up the rear of the procession.</p>

<p>Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage.</p>

<p>Margaret disliked babies, but hit it off better with the two-year-old, and sent Dolly into fits of laughter by talking sense to him.</p>

<p>Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you couldn&#8217;t expect a six-year-old child to know things like that by instinct.</p>

<p>Keith, the proprietary governor, took satanic pleasure in offering to purchase a printing outfit for the eighteen-year-old boy, to make him independent.</p>

<p>She sat behind the stove on the bedshelf, and pretended to catch a fat four-year-old boy, who ran backwards and forwards in front of her, laughing gaily.</p>

<p>The wreath is dedicated in church on the following Sunday; and on Easter Eve the grain is rubbed out of it by a seven-year-old girl and scattered amongst the young corn.</p>

<p>The mother stooped over the first cot, in which a two-year-old little girl lay peacefully sleeping with her little mouth open and her long, curly hair tumbled over the pillow.</p>

<p>Both of these young men aided in the saving of Mrs. William T. Graham, wife of the president of the American Can Company, and Mrs. Graham&#8217;s nineteen-year-old daughter, Margaret.</p>

<p>Mr. Apthorp told of his own similar struggle, and how he had entered a public school and sat for months with ten-year-old-boys, reciting their lessons and catching their phrases.</p>

<p>The 68-year-old President stood outside for the entire proceeding, greeted crowds of well-wishers at the White House later that day, and attended several celebrations that evening.</p>

<p>He thought it natural that the Government should send him out as an adventurer also, with a twenty-three-year-old son, and he did not even notice that he left not a friend behind him.</p>

<p>It was a symptom of alienation between Henry and his wife that the six-year-old son of Elizabeth Blount was at the same time created Duke of Richmond and Lord High Admiral, with much pomp.</p>

<p>Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther&#8217;s point of view (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could wish to avoid.</p>

<p>If you purchase for nursery row planting, six-foot to seven-foot two-year-old apple trees, of the standard sorts, should cost you about thirty cents each; one-year &#8220;buds,&#8221; six feet and branched, five to ten cents less.</p>

<p>We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being taken--when St.-Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the mort--crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two-year-older.</p>

<p>There was one lanky three- year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a &#8220;Vauxhall,&#8221; which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.</p>

<p>The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing boston at the clubs.</p>

<p>All experience since the creation of man, all divine revelation or human science, conspired to deceive and betray a twelve-year-old boy who took for granted that his ideas, which were alone respectable, would be alone respected.</p>

<p>Nineteen-year-old Sanchez did not indeed care for her hand, but merely for her love, and when it began to grow dusk, he stationed himself on the balcony which he had discovered, made signs to her, and flung flowers or bonbons on her table.</p>

<p>And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old creatures--instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die.</p>

<p>When the year had come to an end, he took great pains to reconcile Biorn and Ane, who had often challenged and fought one another, and made them exchange their hatred for friendship; and even entrusted to them his three-year-old son, Olaf, to rear.</p>

<p>Dismissing this, however, she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the daytime, in company with her nine-year-old brother Abraham, and her sister Eliza-Louisa of twelve and a half, call &#8220;&#8217;Liza-Lu,&#8221; the youngest ones being put to bed.</p>

<p>said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.</p>

<p>The grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty-year-old heels, and began to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more: &quot;Ainsi, bornant les cours de tes revasseries, Alcippe, il est donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries.</p>

<p>There on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one containing some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which she was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort, Mrs. Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it.</p>

<p>She was much better fitted for the task than Marilla, for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive understanding of the curious ideas that seven-year-olds sometimes get about matters that are, of course, very plain and simple to grown up people.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s work together to meet these three goals: every eight-year-old must be able to read, every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet, every 18-year-old must be able to go to college, and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.</p>

<p>Next to him sat a University student who was coaching him, and Missy&#8217;s cousin, Michael Sergeivitch Telegin, generally called Misha; opposite him, Katerina Alexeevna, a 40-year-old maiden lady, a Slavophil; and at the foot of the table sat Missy herself, with an empty place by her side.</p>

<p>I have seen twelve-year-old boys working in chains on the public streets of Atlanta, directly in front of the schools, in company with old and hardened criminals; and this indiscriminate mingling of men and women and children makes the chain-gangs perfect schools of crime and debauch- ery.</p>

<p>Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who thought they could.</p>

<p>Both sexes of the wild turkey are ultimately furnished with a tuft of bristles on the breast, but in two-year-old birds the tuft is about four inches long in the male and hardly apparent in the female; when, however, the latter has reached her fourth year, it is from four to five inches in length.</p>

<p>What &#8220;still the same&#8221; might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and swaying, came to a stop.</p>

<p>The Mikados of Japan seem early to have resorted to the expedient of transferring the honours and burdens of supreme power to their infant children; and the rise of the Tycoons, long the temporal sovereigns of the country, is traced to the abdication of a certain Mikado in favour of his three-year-old son.</p>

<p>Thus the important thing for the Protector was more emphatically than before to conciliate France and gain over a strong party in Scotland to support the policy of friendly relations with England; whereof the chief corner stone was still the marriage of Edward who was about ten years old to the four-year-old Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>As for bluff Sir William Phips, he is better remembered for his youthful exploits of hoisting treasure from the fifty-year-old wreck of a Spanish galleon, in the reign of King James, and of building with some of the proceeds his &#8220;fair brick house, in the Green Lane of Boston,&#8221; than for his administration of government during his term of office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna Mikhaylovna&#8217;s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count&#8217;s eldest son; Sonya, the count&#8217;s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Petya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces.</p>

<p>Their wives never came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green thing that grew.</p>

<p>Worst of all, the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law in Boston -- the sight of Court Square packed with bayonets, and his own friends obliged to line the streets under arms as State militia, in order to return a negro to slavery -- wrought frenzy in the brain of a fifteen-year-old, eighteenth-century boy from Quincy, who wanted to miss no reasonable chance of mischief.</p>

<p>Since then, this Congress – across party lines – and the American people have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation – expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.</p>

<p>But had sunk to climb on a firmer footing By nature incapable of asking pardon Cajoled like a twenty-year-old yahoo at college Careful not to smell of his office Challenged him to lead up to her desired stormy scene Chose to conceive that he thought abstractedly Consciousness of some guilt when vowing itself innocent Consign discussion to silence with the cynical closure Convictions we store--wherewith to shape our destinies Convincing themselves that they impersonate sagacity Could not understand enthusiasm for the schoolmaster&#8217;s career Could we--we might be friends Curious thing would be if curious things should fail to happen Death is only the other side of the ditch Death is always next door Desire of it destroyed it Detestable feminine storms enveloping men weak enough Didn&#8217;t say a word No use in talking about feelings Distaste for all exercise once pleasurable Divided lovers in presence Enthusiasm struck and tightened the loose chord of scepticism Enthusiast, when not lyrical, is perilously near to boring Exult in imagination of an escape up to the moment of capture Few men can forbear to tell a spicy story of their friends Greatest of men; who have to learn from the loss of the woman Having contracted the fatal habit of irony He had to shake up wrath over his grievances He had gone, and the day lived again for both of them He gave a slight sign of restiveness, and was allowed to go He loathed a skulker He took small account of the operations of the feelings He began ambitiously--It&#8217;s the way at the beginning Her vehement fighting against facts Her duel with Time His aim to win the woman acknowledged no obstacle in the means His restored sense of possession Hopeless task of defending a woman from a woman How to compromise the matter for the sake of peace?</p>

<p>Suddenly, he found that the money was still in his hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly out upon the night air rang the cry of a crane.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he heard her voice, faintly: &quot;Jurgis!</p>

<p>Suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without, came--fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly a mounted knight appeared, who hailed the king in French.</p>

<p>Suddenly his gaze became fixed, like that of an eagle on its prey.</p>

<p>Suddenly Boris stepped forward, and shook his fist in Tommy&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Suddenly the touchstone of the morning light tinged everything with gold.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a step beside him and felt a cool hand on his forehead.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.</p>

<p>Suddenly resolute, she rushed downstairs, and tremblingly stood before him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time.</p>

<p>Suddenly put down among boys of my own age, I found I had a great deal to learn.</p>

<p>Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go.</p>

<p>Suddenly and imperceptibly the reader finds himself elevated from a trivial scene.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a strange concert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket.</p>

<p>Suddenly we came upon the Professor linked arm-in-arm with--Sir Adolphus Cordery!</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.</p>

<p>Suddenly the music of the Grosvater dance struck up, and every one rushed from the table.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eye fell upon the sprawling frame of Billali, and she seemed to recollect herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the King exclaimed, &#8217;&#8216;Tis the wrath of Shagpat that his assailants remain uncastigated!&#8217;</p>

<p>Suddenly Hanssen sang out that he saw something funny in front -- what it was he did not know.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes said sweetly, &quot;Would none of you like a cup of tea?</p>

<p>Suddenly, as though bereft of his senses, he moved forward, staggering helplessly, towards the table.</p>

<p>Suddenly she seized his head between her hands, kissed him hurriedly on the forehead, crying, &#8220;Adieu!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over me, shortly afterwards adding another to my covering.</p>

<p>Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, the wheels half emerged from the ruts.</p>

<p>Suddenly the child asked, in a voice of unconcern: &#8216;Do you think my father&#8217;s going to die, Miss Brangwen?&#8217;</p>

<p>Suddenly I thought of what would happen if she discovered me, and the reflection made me turn sick and faint.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word &#8220;Arise!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly I regained consciousness, and called out to Felice to drive away the old man on the moment, who kept tormenting me.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Jali almost disappeared from the saddle as he leaned forward with a jerk and seized a fine young buffalo by the tail.</p>

<p>Suddenly, therefore -- and as if by the hand of magic -- this whole valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.</p>

<p>Suddenly Michel, taking a spring, left the floor and remained suspended in the air, like Murillo&#8217;s monk of the _Cusine des Anges_.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old man, stricken at heart, forgot a passage, and his voice groped in agony, like a blind man at a fair for his lost leader.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard the dining-room echo to a merry peal of laughter from Valentina Ignatievna, and the General reply to that outburst: &quot;&#8217;Ah, that man!</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw a handsome door; so she opened it and found herself in a flower-garden finer than the first--ne&#8217;er saw eyes of seer a fairer than it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the beast extended its arms, or rather legs, and inclosed him in a grasp that might have vied with the far-famed power of the &#8220;bear&#8217;s hug&#8221; itself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface.</p>

<p>Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot was heard and then another, a long way off; and for four hours they heard from time to time near or distant reports and rallying cries, strange words of challenge, uttered in guttural voices.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on one of the officers&#8217; saying that it was humiliating to look at the French, Rostov began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the officers: &#8220;How can you judge what&#8217;s best?&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly some one known to us falls--a shell strikes amongst the crowd and causes some involuntary movements--we begin to feel that we are no longer perfectly at ease and collected; even the bravest is at least to some degree confused.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rumour spread about that Cesare, the pope&#8217;s second son, was the author of the deed, and although the inquiries then ceased and no conclusive evidence has yet come to light, there is every probability that the charge was well founded.</p>

<p>Suddenly there swept down from a bluff above us, on the Georgia side, a mingling of shout and roar and rattle as of a tornado let loose; and as a storm of bullets came pelting against the sides of the vessel, and through a window, there went up a shrill answering shout from our own men.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous palace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of jacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is still more rare.</p>

<p>Suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged by the shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, now intersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; a retrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself, Wellington drew back.</p>

<p>Suddenly she that rode upon his left Clung to the shield that Lancelot lent him, crying, &#8217;Yield, yield him this again: &#8216;tis he must fight: I curse the tongue that all through yesterday Reviled thee, and hath wrought on Lancelot now To lend thee horse and shield: wonders ye have done; Miracles ye cannot: here is glory enow In having flung the three: I see thee maimed, Mangled: I swear thou canst not fling the fourth.&#8217;</p>

<p>Suddenly wakened with a sound of talk And laughter at the limit of the wood, And glancing through the hoary boles, he saw, Strange as to some old prophet might have seemed A vision hovering on a sea of fire, Damsels in divers colours like the cloud Of sunset and sunrise, and all of them On horses, and the horses richly trapt Breast-high in that bright line of bracken stood: And all the damsels talked confusedly, And one was pointing this way, and one that, Because the way was lost.</p>

<p>It reminded them of the enchanted forest in &#8220;Undine,&#8221; through which a man might ride forever without finding the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter13chapter13a"><a id="chapter13">Chapter 13</a></h2>

<p>They seem never to have been a warlike race; passing through their country, we once observed a large stone cairn, and our guide favoured us with the following account of it:- &quot;Once upon a time, our forefathers were going to fight another tribe, and here they halted and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Why, sweet.</p>

<p>Why do you cry?&#8217;</p>

<p>Why was I ashamed?</p>

<p>Why this agitation?</p>

<p>Why am I not free?</p>

<p>Why, my pretty youth?</p>

<p>Why should I kill him?</p>

<p>Why does she say that?</p>

<p>Why, I do,&#8217; said Kit.</p>

<p>Why is this door locked?</p>

<p>Why, what shall I learn?</p>

<p>Why should Tamenund stay?</p>

<p>Why is there competition?</p>

<p>Why, goodness gracious!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you come, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why are you out so late?&#8217;</p>

<p>Why, we didn&#8217;t expect you!</p>

<p>Why twinned be we tweyne?&quot;&#8217;</p>

<p>Why, then are you no maiden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you look at the sunset?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why should you conceal it from me?</p>

<p>`Why, where are you off to, Ratty?&#8217;</p>

<p>Why, let&#8217;s tell them we will not go!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why has this been sent to my house?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, just FOR that: to get her away.</p>

<p>Why, you know not,&#8217; said Mr. Creakle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t your children come in, Bessy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the grottos -- caves of the island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why not blow it away with a breath of your lips?</p>

<p>Why, you wouldn&#8217;t break both their hearts now?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he let me be there instead of Tikhon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why cling you at my heels Like an infernal spirit!</p>

<p>Why with some little Traine, My Lord of Buckingham?</p>

<p>Why should a child have less instinct than an animal?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you want to put me under such terrible obligations?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, take you from this place, and carry you away with me abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for your guests?</p>

<p>Why, you might fall in love with the Lord Chancellor himself by that time!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafes.</p>

<p>Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?</p>

<p>Why, you had not very much time for talk,&quot; her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes.</p>

<p>Why, even now some of the biggest stars can&#8217;t go to some towns because they always cop it there.</p>

<p>Why, Kate,&#8217; said Nicholas, drawing his sister towards him and kissing her, &#8217;let me see your face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it seems that his crime is a lasting one, and, consequently, his punishment ought to be so, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, they&#8217;ll tear my cloth for me,&quot; she went on, looking at them from a distance, her strainer in her hand.</p>

<p>Why &#8217;tis no matter man, if they did heare They would not marke me: oh if they did heare They would not pitty me.</p>

<p>Why was this, or why was all mention of any field of duty for the head of the army left out of the army regulations?</p>

<p>Why, you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be writhing all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, my Rane,&#8221; asked the boy, &#8220;may we not cut our way out through that lowland fen, to the open sea and liberty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, I have known him, of course, since I could know anything; but I have never yet discovered what my father does like.</p>

<p>--&#8220;Why, measter,&#8221; cries the fellow, &#8220;you must be come out of your road the Lord knows whither; for thick way goeth to Glocester.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, my boys have been to Cincinnati, with five hundred dollars&#8217; worth of colts, and brought me back the money, all straight, time and agin.</p>

<p>Why, it&#8217;s to swear false oaths!-- unless it&#8217;s possible for a woman to slip out of herself and be another person after a death like that of a love like hers.&#8217;</p>

<p>Why, I know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat of a little boy of eight, because he couldn&#8217;t endure the jokes he made every day at table!</p>

<p>Why, very well: I telling you then, if you be remember&#8217;d, that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you,-- FROTH.</p>

<p>Why is it that when you awake to the world of realities you nearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has carried with it some enigma which you have failed to solve?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, for my part, on the contrary, I should have taken special care to preserve megatheriums and pterodactyles, and all the antediluvian species of which we are unfortunately deprived by his neglect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why did I bring you to this poor, cold little place, on a night like this, when you might have been at River Bank by this time, toasting your toes before a blazing fire, with all your own nice things about you!&#8217;</p>

<p>Why, here begins his morning story right: These two Antipholus&#8217;, these two so like, And these two Dromios, one in semblance,-- Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,-- These are the parents to these children, Which accidentally are met together.</p>

<p>In the third row; fourth from the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter14chapter14a"><a id="chapter14">Chapter 14</a></h2>

<p>He goes on to relate how, once upon a time, a wicked Jew bewitched the prophet Mohammed himself by tying nine knots on a string, which he then hid in a well.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the heat.</p>

<p>And then she said &#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>`And then &#8220;MOME RATHS&#8221;?&#8217;</p>

<p>And then Robert goes off.</p>

<p>And then there is my uncle....</p>

<p>And then began the great reform.</p>

<p>And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy?</p>

<p>&#8220;And then Fanny, Miss Fanny, is so young!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he departed with a great tempest.</p>

<p>And then sobbed out, &quot;With all my heart I do!</p>

<p>And then I pressed him further,&#8220; Kalinin added. &#8221;</p>

<p>And then I will speak to Frank,&#8217; said Lady Arabella.</p>

<p>And then they went in and took possession of the house.</p>

<p>And then the King cried: Where are my knights and my men?</p>

<p>And then I&#8217;ll get a drinking with the landlord and his kin.</p>

<p>And then you&#8217;d know what he was: he was a great sea-captain.</p>

<p>And then the present emergency came on for serious discussion.</p>

<p>And then the travelling tent was taken down and the sledges packed.</p>

<p>And then there was the dog-harness, which we must all have in order.</p>

<p>And then came to her mind those curious questions; what makes a gentleman?</p>

<p>And then that laughed and twirled that&#8217;s tail till you couldn&#8217;t hardly see it.</p>

<p>And then they dressed their shields, and came running together with great ire.</p>

<p>And then, when he arose of his swoon, he cried out sorrowfully, and said: Alas!</p>

<p>And then the will of Louis XIV was not respected; it is likely that mine would be?</p>

<p>&#8220;And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell me what you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>`And then he took the helmet off again--but it took hours and hours to get me out.</p>

<p>And then, Lycas will be sure to want to visit a sick passenger, as part of his duties!</p>

<p>And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress&#8217; eyebrow.</p>

<p>And then hear thou in heaven their prayers, and their supplications, and do judgment for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, instead of comforting me, you leave me entirely in the wrong, and completely in the lurch.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then I shewed her your kind letter; and she made a thousand remarks upon it, and made me wish I had not.</p>

<p>And then, did it not occur to you that once Miss Porter knew the truth she would break her engagement with Clayton?</p>

<p>And then for pity Sir Launcelot withheld his knights, and suffered King Arthur&#8217;s party for to withdraw them aside.</p>

<p>And then came Sir Dinadan with a spear, and he smote Sir Launcelot such a buffet that horse and all fell to the earth.</p>

<p>And then she stopped, to fancy how the noise would sound inside, and how gently it would seem to die away upon the ear.</p>

<p>And then Mr Toogood had only written one short scrap of a letter--just three words, and they were written in triumph.</p>

<p>And then, on rendering his soul to the devil, he would recommend Anne of Austria to make me the inhabitant of a safe place.</p>

<p>And then, as to Campbell&#8217;s interest with Morris, I incline to suppose that it must have been gained by playing upon his fears.</p>

<p>And then he ordered his horses, affirming they should reach Baptista&#8217;s house by dinner-time, for that it was but seven o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>And then he sells me my house at an advanced price, and I buy, and then he votes against a penny for the protection of the shore!</p>

<p>And then the Martian beside us raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report that made the ground heave.</p>

<p>And then a theme I had never heard crept in, and caught my ear at once, because it was quite new to me, and so marvellously sweet.</p>

<p>And then I left my wife to go home by coach, and I walked to the Temple about my law business, and there received a subpoena for T. Trice.</p>

<p>And then suddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his man, rode their way into the forest, that no man perceived where they went.</p>

<p>And then sets to work to persecute him, because he has blood in his veins, because he worships beauty; because he seeks a real marriage, a real mate.</p>

<p>And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.</p>

<p>And then he was gone again into the swaying trees, following the high-flung spoor which no other human eye could have detected, much less translated.</p>

<p>And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream.</p>

<p>And then,&#8220; she had said, &#8221;it isn&#8217;t of course a question of anything expensive, gorged with treasure as Maggie is; it isn&#8217;t a question of competing or outshining.</p>

<p>And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head.</p>

<p>And then, also, the old-fashioned phaeton, of old-fashioned old Dr Century was seen to rumble up to the big house, and it became known that Lady Arabella was not very well.</p>

<p>And then they made a feast in honour of the goddess on the Mount of Bears, singing the praises of Rhea most venerable; but at dawn the winds had ceased and they rowed away from the island.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; said somebody else, &#8220;then there was Petit Gaillard, who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then King Arthur was wood wroth, and ran to the King with the Hundred Knights, and there King Arthur smote him down; and after with that same spear King Arthur smote down three other knights.</p>

<p>And then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh ones spring up, which are akin to them, and because he, their father, does not know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.</p>

<p>And then proceeding to his operation, &#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he, &quot;since I have dealt in suds, I could never discover more than two reasons for shaving; the one is to get a beard, and the other to get rid of one.</p>

<p>And then when it was past noon, and when it drew toward evensong, Sir Gawaine&#8217;s strength feebled, and waxed passing faint that unnethes he might dure any &lt;130&gt;longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>And then he hurl&#8217;d into the night alone, Wailing unto the spirit of his son, That somewhere in dark mist and sighing wind Must dwell, nor yet to Hades had it won, Nor quite had left the world of men behind.</p>

<p>And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed.</p>

<p>And then had these three kings great cheer of King Leodegrance, that thanked them of their great goodness, that they would revenge him of his enemies; and there had Arthur the first sight of Guenever, the king&#8217;s daughter of Cameliard, and ever after he loved her.</p>

<p>And then this passing discriminative power was withdrawn, and Jude was lost to all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure, that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto unsuspected, though it had lain close beside him.</p>

<p>And then turning towards the mills he said aloud, &#8220;Friends, whoe&#8217;er ye be that are immured in that prison, forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for some other knight.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, when thou hast heedfully sought the grace of the goddess, retreat from the pyre; and let neither the sound of feet drive thee to turn back, nor the baying of hounds, lest haply thou shouldst maim all the rites and thyself fail to return duly to thy comrades.</p>

<p>And then came the farmer, a good-like sort of man, grave, and well- behaved; and spoke to me in such sort, as made me a little pacified; and seeing no help for it, I went in; and the wife immediately conducted me up stairs to the best apartment, and told me, that was mine as long as I staid: and nobody should come near me but when I called.</p>

<p>And then, with one of those extraordinary transitions of which I have already spoken, she again threw off her veil, and broke out, after the ancient and poetic fashion of the dwellers in Arabia,[*] into a pæan of triumph or epithalamium, which, wild and beautiful as it was, is exceedingly difficult to render into English, and ought by rights to be sung to the music of a cantata, rather than written and read.</p>

<p>And thence to White Hall, and there staid in Mr. Wren&#8217;s chamber with him, reading over my draught of a letter, which Mr. Gibson then attended me with; and there he did like all, but doubted whether it would be necessary for the Duke to write in so sharp a style to the Office, as I had drawn it in; which I yield to him, to consider the present posture of the times and the Duke of York and whether it were not better to err on that hand than the other.</p>

<p>And then, with small adventure met, Sir Bors Rode to the lonest tract of all the realm, And found a people there among their crags, Our race and blood, a remnant that were left Paynim amid their circles, and the stones They pitch up straight to heaven: and their wise men Were strong in that old magic which can trace The wandering of the stars, and scoffed at him And this high Quest as at a simple thing: Told him he followed--almost Arthur&#8217;s words-- A mocking fire: &#8220;what other fire than he, Whereby the blood beats, and the blossom blows, And the sea rolls, and all the world is warmed?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then we all up to the Duke of York, and there did our usual business, and so I with J. Minnes home, and there finding my wife gone to my aunt Wight&#8217;s, to see her the first time after her coming to town, and indeed the first time, I think, these two years (we having been great strangers one to the other for a great while), I to them; and there mighty kindly used, and had a barrel of oysters, and so to look up and down their house, they having hung a room since I was there, but with hangings not fit to be seen with mine, which I find all come home to-night, and here staying an hour or two we home, and there to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>Nor had he only proposed to himself the end.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, O King of the Age, I had a slipper which hardly belonged to its kind nor ever was there seen a bigger.</p>

<p>At my expression of alarm, she laughed.</p>

<p>Thenks&quot;; and all three of them laughed.</p>

<p>He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, &quot;So!</p>

<p>It was folly, and yet we all laughed heartily.</p>

<p>She laughed: &#8217;I heard it at ten; I slept till four.</p>

<p>No, sir,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I hear nothing,&#8217; and he laughed.</p>

<p>Farina laughed, but answered, &#8217;Look, you of the Club!</p>

<p>He laughed low: a sizar&#8217;s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.</p>

<p>She slapped them on the shoulders and laughed a great deal.</p>

<p>Damn it all, I don&#8217;t want to be interesting,&quot; laughed Philip.</p>

<p>She can blow him up as well as shine on him,&quot; laughed Laurie.</p>

<p>He danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed.</p>

<p>laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, really making the whole house vibrate.</p>

<p>He laughed and talked with a strange boisterousness, as the people thought.</p>

<p>Oraetes laughed, none the worse, that moment, of his hundred and fourteen years.</p>

<p>laughed the young count, throwing his arm over the shoulder of the artisan&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>The king laughed, while Earl Douglas cast at John Heywood a sharp, spiteful look.</p>

<p>She laughed and said: &quot;Then shalt thou have him with thee as thy captive and thrall.</p>

<p>Hereupon Nur al-Huda laughed till she fell backwards and rolled round on her side.</p>

<p>At first Yann laughed, but now he looked at Gaud with kind eyes, questioning deeply.</p>

<p>The child scampered, with all his little strength, after the prize, while his master laughed.</p>

<p>She merely laughed, and said that she imagined Mr Slope found other attraction at Dr Stanhope&#8217;s.</p>

<p>He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge.</p>

<p>He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed.</p>

<p>At this, the Bishop glared like an angry cat, while even Sir Richard laughed; only Robin kept a grave face.</p>

<p>Then evil was the end of the evil doers; because they had treated our signs as lies, and laughed them to scorn.</p>

<p>She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even repeated after Biddy, the words &#8220;Pip&#8221; and &#8220;Property.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thomas Seymour laughed, and did not consider it worth his while to defend himself against the accusations of the fool.</p>

<p>The surprise among those who had brought in this seemingly young dancer was so great that no one laughed, no one said a word.</p>

<p>And a thousand caricatures of children, angels, owls, fools, and child- sized butterflies laughed and mocked, and roared at me.</p>

<p>She nodded, and then uttered some rapid words, glanced at him, laughed shyly, and sank her features into repose as we drew near.</p>

<p>Hurried counsel rage and craft Yelped to hungry men, whose teeth Hard the grey lip-ringlet gnawed, Gleaming till their fury laughed.</p>

<p>Dear me, it doesn&#8217;t seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child.</p>

<p>Charlotta, who would probably have obeyed if Miss Lavendar had told her to stand on her head, climbed upon the stone bench and laughed loud and heartily.</p>

<p>Then home he returned when the wager was lost, With sorrow of heart, I may say; The lady she laughed to find her love crost, - This was upon midsummer-day.</p>

<p>As the examination proceeded I cast a glance at Thurid and startled him looking wide-eyed and wonderingly at me, and then of a sudden he laughed full in my face.</p>

<p>Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his hole very funny indeed.</p>

<p>But the soldier began to suspect something, be mistrustful, and when they laughed too loud he would roll his eyes uneasily, and sometimes they lighted up with anger.</p>

<p>Some laughed at the &#8220;scholars,&#8221; and went over the other side of the forecastle, to work, and spin their yarns; but I carried the day, and had the cream of the crew for my hearers.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied.</p>

<p>CLER: O, by no means, she may not refuse--to stay at home, if you love your reputation: &#8216;Slight, you are invited thither o&#8217; purpose to be seen, and laughed at by the lady of the college, and her shadows.</p>

<p>His good-nature soon put her at her ease; and although she still denied the charge, she laughed so heartily at it, that Nicholas had the satisfaction of feeling assured that in all essential respects it was strictly true.</p>

<p>Once in the street, moved by some secret impulse, he laughed, and held his sides, and laughed again, and tried to peer through the dusty area railings as if to catch another glimpse of the child, until he was quite tired out.</p>

<p>Hereupon the youth laughed aloud and cried, &#8220;By Allah, thy son hath not suffered aught from the shifts and changes of the World, and he is still in the bonds of life, safe and sound; nor hath there befallen him anything of harm whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expression of deluded subjects is become so hacknied and contemptible, and the more so when we see them making prisoners of whole armies at a time, that the pride of not being laughed at would induce a man of common sense to leave it off.</p>

<p>In front of the door a clucking hen was scratching in the dust with a brood of chickens about her heels, the sparrows were chattering of household affairs under the eaves, and all was so sweet and peaceful that Little John&#8217;s heart laughed within him.</p>

<p>In a word, I confess my own weakness; I was willing that they should continue my debtors, and have little doubt that they had not the slightest objection to remain so; they kept their money, and probably laughed in their sleeves at my want of common sense.</p>

<p>Emilia, though she thought it natural that Braintop should carry a pocket-mirror if he pleased, laughed from sympathy; until Braintop, reduced to the verge of forbearance, stood up and remarked that, to perform the mission entrusted to him, he must depart immediately.</p>

<p>After Ragnar had thus triumphed the king scanned his dress closely, and saw that he was rough and hairy; but, above all, he laughed at the shaggy lower portion of his garb, and chiefly the uncouth aspect of his breeches; so that he gave him in jest the nickname of Lodbrog.</p>

<p>they laughed, and death was in the midst of them; they laughed, and the gates of the Tower were already opened to admit one of those merry guests of the king into that house which no one in those days of Henry the Eighth left again, save to go to the stake or to ascend the scaffold!</p>

<p>However it was, he rode beside her and rejoiced to hear the young girl&#8217;s talk of her father as a captain of one of England&#8217;s thunderers, and of the cruelty of that Admiralty to him: at which Admiral Baldwin laughed, but had not the heart to disagree with her, for he could belabour the Admiralty in season, cause or no cause.</p>

<p>But it was no use; she was ill-content while her father and others called him buccaneer and filibuster, and she joyed that old William Drayton, who had ever spoken well of the young Frenchman, laughed at their insults, saying that he was as brave, comely, and fine- tempered a lad as he had ever met, and that the capture of the forts was genius: &#8220;Genius and pith, upon my soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rebecca passed that night in constant watching upon Miss Crawley; the next night the old lady slept so comfortably, that Rebecca had time for several hours&#8217; comfortable repose herself on the sofa, at the foot of her patroness&#8217;s bed; very soon, Miss Crawley was so well that she sat up and laughed heartily at a perfect imitation of Miss Briggs and her grief, which Rebecca described to her.</p>

<p>This being one of the standing jokes between the old fellows and Tim, they all three laughed very heartily, and might have laughed much longer, but that the brothers, seeing that Mrs Nickleby was labouring to express her feelings, and was really overwhelmed by the happiness of the time, took her between them, and led her from the room under pretence of having to consult her on some most important arrangements.</p>

<p>At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards--she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions.</p>

<p>When I was in France, I heard from one Dr. Pena, that the Queen Mother, who was given to curious arts, caused the King her husband&#8217;s nativity to be calculated, under a false name; and the astrologer gave a judgment, that he should be killed in a duel; at which the Queen laughed, thinking her hus- band to be above challenges and duels: but he was slain upon a course at tilt, the splinters of the staff of Montgomery going in at his beaver.</p>

<p>She even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the dinner-guests laugh and shout over; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut, where, of course, it didn&#8217;t fit and hadn&#8217;t any point; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way, while I could see that she was wondering to herself why it didn&#8217;t seem as funny as it did when she first heard it.</p>

<p>He laughed me in the face, and said: “Wait and see, Benvenuto; for by the time that you have finished that work of yours, I will make haste to have finished this vase, which I took in hand when you did the jewel; and then experience shall teach you what profit I shall get from my vase, and what you will get from your ornament.” I answered that I was very glad indeed to enter into such a competition with so good a craftsman as he was, because the end would show which of us was mistaken.</p>

<p>I will take care of what Curdie thinks of you in the end.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV THE ROUND TABLE The famous enchanter, Merlin, had exerted all his skill in fabricating the Round Table.</p>

<p>In the enchantment of her realized dream, she pressed close to him, always anxious, feeling that he was as flighty as a wild sea-bird.</p>

<p>And doubtless this was an enchantment devised by the people of the city, to repel any who should seek to gaze upon or to enter the place.</p>

<p>Distant hills enchant my sight, Ever young and ever fair; To those hills I&#8217;d take my flight Had I wings to scale the air.</p>

<p>The next evening after the trial the little girl begged Ozma to allow her to look in the enchanted picture, and the Princess readily consented.</p>

<p>Quoth she, &#8220;Not so, &#8217;tis Ali the Cairene, whom the Jew Azariah hath enchanted;&#8221; and she turned to the dog and said to him, &#8220;Art not Ali of Cairo?&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole sky is blue, the fields are green, the houses all white, and our enchanted eyes drink in those bright colors which bring delight to our souls.</p>

<p>7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>

<p>To humble, alas, each too-haughty emotion That swelled my proud breast, from the foam of the ocean Fair Venus arose, to enchant gods and men!</p>

<p>It was Flordelis, whose lover, Florismart, as we have related, had met the fate of Orlando and many more, and fallen a victim to the enchantress of the cup.</p>

<p>LV If she had been in that enchanted hold, She might before have seen the cavalier Wandering with Bradamant, Rogero bold, Gradasso and Ferrau and Brava&#8217;s peer.</p>

<p>Nor is the day of love for ever dead, When young enchantment and romance are gone; The veil is drawn, but all the future dread Is lightened by the finger of the dawn.</p>

<p>And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons, and of diviners, who mutter in their enchantments: should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead?</p>

<p>It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air.</p>

<p>In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.</p>

<p>And ofttimes Merlin would have had her privily away by his subtle crafts; then she made him to swear that he &lt;103&gt;should never do none enchantment upon her if he would have his will.</p>

<p>Stand now with thy enchanters, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast laboured from thy youth, if so be it may profit thee any thing, or if thou mayst become stronger.</p>

<p>She began to think her muteness lost her the bloom of the enchantment, robbing her of her heavenly frolic lead, since friend Matey resolved to be as eminently good in salt water as on land.</p>

<p>As a result of the enchantment Jellia took on the form and features of Mombi, while the old witch grew to resemble the girl so closely that it seemed impossible anyone could guess the deception.</p>

<p>When the enchanter saw her prostrate he made his horse alight on the ground, and, dismounting, fixed the shield on the pommel of his saddle, and approached in order to secure the fallen warrior.</p>

<p>Examine not, O child of man!--examine not that mysterious melancholy with the hard eyes of thy reason; thou canst not impale it on the spikes of thy thorny logic, nor describe its enchanted circle by problems conned from thy schools.</p>

<p>On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king&#8217;s son came and cried: &#8216;Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>He soon met with a weeping damsel, who, being questioned as to the cause of her sorrow, told him she was in search of one to do battle to rescue her lover, who had been made prisoner by a vile enchantress, together with Orlando and many more.</p>

<p>&#8220;To that we answer you,&#8221; said he of the Mirrors, &#8220;that you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether you are the said person or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this short interval Don Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea&#8217;s enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don Alvaro into fresh amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho he went his way, and Don Quixote went his.</p>

<p>She smiled with unspeakable sweetness, and said there would be no want of opportunities, provided I could maintain the good opinion her brother had conceived of me, and I, enchanted by her charms, seized her hand, which I well nigh devoured with kisses.</p>

<p>(29) &#8220;The word `Thessala&#8217; was a common one in Latin, as meaning `enchantress&#8216;, `sorceress&#8217;, `witch&#8217;, as Pliny himself tells us, adding that the art of enchantment was not, however, indigenous to Thessaly, but came originally from Persia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hearken, for this concerneth thee: he made a tale of me of true and false mingled, that I was a wise-wife and an enchantress, and my lord trowed in him, so that I was put to shame before all the house, and driven forth wrung with anguish, barefoot and bleeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, &quot;I have now come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world?</p>

<p>Now, he was roiled by the enchantments of the Queen, caught in the snare of her beguilings; and he let her lead him to a seat beside her on the throne, and sat there awhile in the midst of feastings, mazed, thinking, &#8216;What life have I lived before this, if the matter be as I behold?&#8217;</p>

<p>I was in a great state of anxiety about the water supply, and Tietkens and I walked first after the horses, and then took them up to the glen, where I was enchanted to behold the stream again in full flow, and the sheets of surface water as large, and as fine as when we first saw them yesterday.</p>

<p>Uct Dealv went then to the house of Fergus Fionnliath, and she broke the enchantment that was on the hound, so that Tuiren&#8217;s own shape came back to her; but in the matter of two small whelps, to which the hound had given birth, the enchantment could not be broken, so they had to remain as they were.</p>

<p>She had to check fancies drawn from Arabian tales, concerning the help sometimes given by genii of the air and enchanted birds, that were so incessant and vivid that she found herself sulking at the loneliness and helplessness of the visible sky, and feared that her brain was losing its hold of things.</p>

<p>Don John, as in his Moorish disguise he had looked upon her perfections, had felt in danger of becoming really the slave he personated--&#8220;her beauty is more divine than human,&#8221; he had cried, &#8220;but fitter to destroy men&#8217;s souls than to bless them;&#8221; and now the enchantress was on her way to his dominions.</p>

<p>She that doth call me husband, even my soul Doth for a wife abhor; but her fair sister, Possess&#8217;d with such a gentle sovereign grace, Of such enchanting presence and discourse, Hath almost made me traitor to myself: But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong, I&#8217;ll stop mine ears against the mermaid&#8217;s song.</p>

<p>Two or three individuals hinted that the man of skill, during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests, who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters, often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these mishaps have befallen thee, hardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and God grant thy squire Sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that dearly beloved Dulcinea of thine may never be released from her enchantment, that thou mayest never come to her bed, at least while I who adore thee am alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a good joke for your worship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the Royal Council, as if they were people who would allow such a lot of lies to be printed all together, and so many battles and enchantments that they take away one&#8217;s senses.&#8221;</p>

<p>By God, gentlemen,&#8220; said Don Quixote, &#8221;so many strange things have happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have sojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively in reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my belief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment.</p>

<p>Then again they sought a singer, Magic minstrel, beer-enchanter, Thus to praise the drink of heroes, Sing the songs of joy and gladness; And a boy was brought for singing; But the boy had little knowledge, Could not praise the beer in honor; Children&#8217;s tongues are filled with questions, Children cannot speak in wisdom, Cannot sing the ancient legends.</p>

<p>Yet the philosopher who trembles at the idea of such distant catastrophes may console himself by reflecting that these gloomy apprehensions, like the earth and the sun themselves, are only parts of that unsubstantial world which thought has conjured up out of the void, and that the phantoms which the subtle enchantress has evoked to-day she may ban to-morrow.</p>

<p>She had to lock herself in her room for an hour of deadly abandonment to misery, resembling the run of poison through her blood, before she could bear to lift eyes on her friend; to whom subsequently she said: &#8217;Emmy, there are wounds that cut sharp as the enchanter&#8217;s sword, and we don&#8217;t know we are in halves till some rough old intimate claps us on the back, merely to ask us how we are!</p>

<p>Miranda, who thought all men had grave faces and grey beards like her father, was delighted with the appearance of this beautiful young prince; and Ferdinand, seeing such a lovely lady in this desert place, and from the strange sounds he had heard, expecting nothing but wonders, thought he was upon an enchanted island, and that Miranda was the goddess of the place, and as such he began to address her.</p>

<p>All under foot was fresh grass, in Syria the rarest and most beautiful production of the soil; if he looked up, it was to see the sky paley blue through the groinery of countless date-bearers, very patriarchs of their kind, so numerous and old, and of such mighty girth, so tall, so serried, so wide of branch, each branch so perfect with fronds, plumy and waxlike and brilliant, they seemed enchanters enchanted.</p>

<p>A Form most like the imagined habitant Of silver exhalations sprung from dawn, By winds which feed on sunrise woven, to enchant The faiths of men: all mortal eyes were drawn, _2110 As famished mariners through strange seas gone Gaze on a burning watch-tower, by the light Of those divinest lineaments--alone With thoughts which none could share, from that fair sight I turned in sickness, for a veil shrouded her countenance bright.</p>

<p>Not knowing any more whether time existed, whether the vision had lasted a second or a hundred years, not knowing any more whether there existed a Siddhartha, a Gotama, a me and a you, feeling in his innermost self as if he had been wounded by a divine arrow, the injury of which tasted sweet, being enchanted and dissolved in his innermost self, Govinda still stood for a little while bent over Siddhartha&#8217;s quiet face, which he had just kissed, which had just been the scene of all manifestations, all transformations, all existence.</p>

<p>And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I never spoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to be envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of the rogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity, always natural and never acted; and if I had no other merit save that I believe, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and all the holy Roman Catholic Church holds and believes, and that I am a mortal enemy of the Jews, the historians ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their writings.</p>

<p>&#8220;And thou, highest perfection of excellence that can be desired, utmost limit of grace in human shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart that adores thee, though the malign enchanter that persecutes me has brought clouds and cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them only, transformed thy unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into those of a poor peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same time changed mine into those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy sight, refuse not to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing in this submission that I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the humility with which my soul adores thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>SECOND FAUN: &#8217;Tis hard to tell; I have heard those more skilled in spirits say, _70 The bubbles, which the enchantment of the sun Sucks from the pale faint water-flowers that pave The oozy bottom of clear lakes and pools, Are the pavilions where such dwell and float Under the green and golden atmosphere _75 Which noontide kindles through the woven leaves; And when these burst, and the thin fiery air, The which they breathed within those lucent domes, Ascends to flow like meteors through the night, They ride on them, and rein their headlong speed, _80 And bow their burning crests, and glide in fire Under the waters of the earth again.</p>

<p>For myself I can say that since I have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous, well-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my faith, senor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree; and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith without works is dead.</p>

<p>Thou hast forgotten, O Sancho, those lines of our poet wherein he paints for us how, in their crystal abodes, those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which the ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were worked and woven with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort must have been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only that the spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes all those things that give me pleasure, and turns them into shapes unlike their own; and so I fear that in that history of my achievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author was some sage who is an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for another, mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relating transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history.</p>

<p>12 For what was prepared for them, the righteous did eat; and they shall not be delivered from evil.</p>

<p>Kuzma Vassilyevitch laughed, took the cards, and all evil thoughts immediately slipped out of his mind.</p>

<p>For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him.</p>

<p>And it was in such a light and atmosphere that men could fancy they traced in them enormous and evil faces, looking down.</p>

<p>.That is, an adversary watching constantly to do harm, as the evil spirit is always watching and seeking whom he may devour.</p>

<p>Ever you&#8217;ve served me, and so long a time, By you Carlon hath conquered kingdoms wide; That Emperour reared you for evil plight!</p>

<p>That is why I should really like to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil thoughts of him did not leave me.</p>

<p>The battle of Lutzen soon followed, in which Francis Albert, like an evil genius, kept close to the king&#8217;s side and did not leave him till he fell.</p>

<p>There is one man left, by whom we may inquire of the Lord; Micheas, the son of Jemla: but I hate him, for he doth not prophecy good to me, but evil.</p>

<p>Pour on those evil men the love that lies _1660 Hovering within those spirit-soothing eyes-- Arise, my friend, farewell!&#8217;</p>

<p>In the abyss of evil into which I am plunged, I feel the blows reach me, without perceiving the hand by which they are directed or the means it employs.</p>

<p>Where an exact copying makes our pictures less striking, we choose the less evil; deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth, than beauty.</p>

<p>And you also have done worse than your fathers: for behold every one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil heart, so as not to hearken to me.</p>

<p>And now it is done; now for thee I loose my virgin zone; and come storm, come shine, come good, come evil, come life, come death, it never, never can be undone.</p>

<p>By dwelling on the sanctity of human life, Christianity did its best to repress the very common practice of suicide as well as the frightful evil of infanticide.</p>

<p>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</p>

<p>In connection with the fight he bore also the names, &#8220;annihilator of the enemy,&#8221; &#8220;rooter out of all evil,&#8221; &#8220;troubler of the evil ones,&#8221; &#8220;life of the whole of the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Or, to again employ the figure, evil is the product of incest between adverse powers; good will sooner or later be the legitimate child of their holy and mysterious union.</p>

<p>Would not the earth, quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye, greet him with poisonous shrubs of species hitherto unknown, that would start up under his fingers?</p>

<p>31:29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: 31:30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>

<p>A throng of evil, base, or irritated souls, who have traversed life and have vanished into eternity, linger there almost entirely visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word.</p>

<p>Well, my fellow, said the lord of that castle, for Sir Aglovale&#8217;s sake thou shalt have evil lodging, for Sir Aglovale slew my brother, and therefore thou shalt die on part of payment.</p>

<p>The Holy Souls well understand and weigh the greatness of this evil; and very piercing is the pain they feel, because they know that they are suffering through their own negligence and by their own fault....</p>

<p>And all this was soft and full of delight for my soul: and I, whose body a little while ago had been driven to daily toil with evil words and stripes, and who had known not what words of thanks and praise might mean!</p>

<p>We may, under the guidance of reason, seek a greater good in the future in preference to a lesser good in the present, and we may seek a lesser evil in the present in preference to a greater evil in the future.</p>

<p>To the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary succession; and as the first is a degradation and lessening of ourselves, so the second, claimed as a matter of right, is an insult and an imposition on posterity.</p>

<p>To remedy this evil, it was evident to my mind that some person should have the supreme command of all the forces in the Department of West Virginia, Washington, Susquehanna, and the Middle Department, and I so recommended.</p>

<p>86 Whosoever therefore shall follow her shall be happy in all his life, because he shall abstain from all evil works, believing that if he shall contain himself from all concupiscence, he shall be the heir of eternal life.</p>

<p>As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because of, and so far as, its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity.</p>

<p>Especially if there was anything discreditable to be found out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and if he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were discovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit.</p>

<p>But the distinguishing feature of this second division of our knowledge is, on the one hand, the good or the evil which we derive from our opinions; and, on the other, the obstinacy with which we defend the prejudice which is tormenting and killing us.</p>

<p>6 Ready to evil speaking, not knowing him that made them; murderers of children; corrupters of the creature of God; that turn away from the needy; oppress the afflicted; are the advocates of the rich, but unjust judges of the poor; being altogether sinners.</p>

<p>8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man&#8217;s sake; for the imagination of man&#8217;s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</p>

<p>When we were there, where it is hollowed out Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged, The Guide said: &#8220;Wait, and see that on thee strike The vision of those others evil-born, Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces, Because together with us they have gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He is a man of very little honesty, and on account of this the people and the captains are much discontented with his evil life and inclinations; for he has never done anything except those things that are desired by his two brothers-in-law,[593] who are men very evilly disposed and great Jews.</p>

<p>Do then to that which is under your control all the evil you are able.” The captain, in some alarm, and not knowing what I might be on the point of doing, said to four of his tallest fellows: “Put all your arms aside.” When they had done so, he added: “Now upon the instant leap on him, and secure him well.</p>

<p>In all occasions of danger and distress, it was the practice of the primitive Christians to fortify their minds and bodies by the sign of the cross, which they used, in all their ecclesiastical rites, in all the daily occurrences of life, as an infallible preservative against every species of spiritual or temporal evil.</p>

<p>When I saw that my fear was going so far, it struck me--because I was making progress in prayer--that this must be a great blessing, or a very great evil; for I understood perfectly that what had happened was something supernatural, because at times I was unable to withstand it; to have it when I would was also impossible.</p>

<p>And when the word of the Lord came in the hand of Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet, against Baasa, and against his house, and against all the evil that he had done before the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the works of his hands, to become as the house of Jeroboam: for this cause he slew him; that is to say, Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet.</p>

<p>While we are struggling to suppress an evil of great proportions like that of impure food, we must provide machinery in the law itself to prevent its becoming an instrument of oppression, and we ought to enable those whose business is threatened with annihilation to have some tribunal and some form of appeal in which they have a complete day in court.</p>

<p>note) that we in no case desire a thing because we deem it good, but, contrariwise, we deem a thing good because we desire it: consequently we deem evil that which we shrink from; everyone, therefore, according to his particular emotions, judges or estimates what is good, what is bad, what is better, what is worse, lastly, what is best, and what is worst.</p>

<p>And now, like swallows ere the winter weather, The women in shrill groups were gathering, With eager tongues still communing together, And many a taunt at Helen would they fling, Ay, through her innocence she felt the sting, And shamed was now her gentle face and sweet, For e&#8217;en the children evil songs would sing To mock her as she hasted down the street.</p>

<p>Note.- Superstitions persons, who know better how to rail at vice than how to teach virtue, and who strive not to guide men by reason, but so to restrain them that they would rather escape evil than love virtue, have no other aim but to make others as wretched as themselves; wherefore it is nothing wonderful, if they be generally troublesome and odious to their fellow-men.</p>

<p>Thus Adam to himself lamented loud, Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell, Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom; Which to his evil conscience represented All things with double terrour: On the ground Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft Cursed his creation; Death as oft accused Of tardy execution, since denounced The day of his offence.</p>

<p>These were Jehovah&#8217;s words:-- _105 &#8216;From an eternity of idleness I, God, awoke; in seven days&#8217; toil made earth From nothing; rested, and created man: I placed him in a Paradise, and there Planted the tree of evil, so that he _110 Might eat and perish, and My soul procure Wherewith to sate its malice, and to turn, Even like a heartless conqueror of the earth, All misery to My fame.</p>

<p>The judge who by word or deed makes it plain that the corrupt corporation, the law-defying corporation, the law-defying rich man, has in him a sure and trustworthy ally, the judge who by misuse of the process of injunction makes it plain that in him the wage-worker has a determined and unscrupulous enemy, the judge who when he decides in an employers&#8217; liability or a tenement house factory case shows that he has neither sympathy for nor understanding of those fellow-citizens of his who most need his sympathy and understanding; these judges work as much evil as if they pandered to the mob, as if they shrank from sternly repressing violence and disorder.</p>

<p>2:5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 2:6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds: 2:7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: 2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 2:10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 2:11 For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>

<p>119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you see, excellent Boythorn and I would go to dinner after all!&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, he raised his quarterstaff above his head in a threatening way.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that in my opinion it would be better to advance with the utmost care.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Hebrew and the Greek would have carried all humanity forward and upward.</p>

<p>So it almost certainly is with male lambs, and probably with some other animals.</p>

<p>So spake he in wisdom and in modesty; And all there marvelled at the godlike man.</p>

<p>So his friend said to him, &quot;How often did I tell thee thou hadst no luck in wheat?</p>

<p>So, if you lose, get out of the room-- Get out of the room when your time is up.</p>

<p>So the young man arose and rapped and called out, &#8220;Bring in the breakfast;&#8221; when lo!</p>

<p>So silent fountains, from a rock&#8217;s tall head, In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.</p>

<p>So she stayed there and washed the pots and scraped the saucepans and did all the dirty work.</p>

<p>So be it--with the understanding that I can&#8217;t go beyond that day, neighbour, on any account.&#8217;</p>

<p>So he arose and brought her a gugglet of water; but she cried to him, &#8220;Who said to thee, Fetch that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you thought a monkey had told me what any fool could have seen if he had watched you for five minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I feared for my life sitting there alone; and at last I arose and walked home reeling like a drunken man.</p>

<p>So was it given to Segwarides, whereof he thanked &lt;346&gt;them; and so was he lord, and worshipfully he did govern it.</p>

<p>So the old woman halted and said, &quot;Here we are, O my son, and glory be to Him who hath brought us thus far in safety!</p>

<p>So again, male dragon-flies (Libellulidae) are sometimes sensibly larger, and never smaller, than the females (16.</p>

<p>So far the authority of the United States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the future.</p>

<p>So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood.</p>

<p>So with this the situation, to her view, would appear to have cleared had she not too quickly had one of her restless relapses.</p>

<p>So he made for the city of Ilan Shah and built himself a palace therein and transporting his wealth thither, took up his abode there.</p>

<p>So it grew late and dark by the time Sennacherib returned to the old man, and he had to procure a light before his hair could be cut.</p>

<p>So my father fitted out six ships for me and my people; and we put to sea and sailed for the space of a full month till we made the land.</p>

<p>So when Tros heard these tidings from Zeus, he no longer kept mourning but rejoiced in his heart and rode joyfully with his storm-footed horses.</p>

<p>So he took me into the great cabin, and there sat a good sort of a gentlemanly man for a seaman, writing, and with a great many papers before him.</p>

<p>So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it were something new.</p>

<p>So home, and to see Sir W. Batten, who is pretty well again, and then to my uncle Wight&#8217;s to show my fine band and to see Mrs. Margaret Wight, but she was not there.</p>

<p>So I took his hand and, leading him to my house, said to the damsel, &#8220;O my mistress, I have brought a blind singer, with whom we may take our pleasure and he will not see us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, so,&#8221; said the gentleman to himself at this; &#8220;our worthy knight has shown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his skull and brought his brains to a head.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I to Lovett&#8217;s, and there to my trouble saw plainly that my project of varnished books will not take, it not keeping colour, not being able to take polishing upon a single paper.</p>

<p>So Ja&#8217;afar took from me the single bean and, splitting it in twain, kept one half himself and gave the other to one of his concubines, saying, &#8216;For how much wilt thou buy this half bean?&#8217;</p>

<p>So they ate till they had enough and washed their hands, after which said the young man, &#8220;O my lords, if you have any want, let us know it, that we may have the honour of satisfying it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she betook herself thither and entering the fortalice, found it hung and carpeted with stuffs of silk and great plenty of gold and silver vessels; and therein were an hundred beautiful damsels.</p>

<p>So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the following story: &quot;I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living.</p>

<p>So far, therefore, the relation of the goat to Athena is parallel to the relation of the horse to Virbius, both animals being excluded from the sanctuary on the ground of injury done by them to the god.</p>

<p>So they got out of a farmhouse about half a mile from the church, where the offence of the carriage and the livery-servant would be well out of Mr Crawley&#8217;s sight, and from thence walked towards the parsonage.</p>

<p>So he alighted at one of the tents of the camp and there came forth to him a man of short stature and loathly aspect, who saluted him and lodging him in a corner of the tent, sat entertaining him with talk, the goodliest that might be.</p>

<p>So, she gone, comes my wife and to walk in the garden, Sir J. Minnes being still ill and so keeping us from singing, and by and by Sir W. Pen come and walked with us and gave us a bottle of Syder, and so we home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>So I kissed his hand and going out from before him, repaired to the sea-coast, where I took ship with many other merchants and we sailed days and nights, till, after a prosperous voyage, God vouchsafed us a safe arrival at the island of Serendib.</p>

<p>So in his _Study of Celtic Literature_ (an interesting book, by the way) he wrote with surprising confidence for one who had no first-hand acquaintance with his material, and led his readers pleasantly astray in the flowery fields of Celtic poetry.</p>

<p>So he took up Al-Razi and carrying him forth of the cemetery, stayed not till he came to the Magians&#8217; mortuary place and casting him down in a Tower of Silence,[FN#466] rained heavy blows upon him till his shoulders failed him, but the other stirred not.</p>

<p>So, on the morrow which was the third day, he went down to the lake and stood there, till there came up a third Moor, riding on a mule with saddle bags and still more richly accoutred than the first two, who said to him, &#8220;Peace be with thee, O Judar, O son of Omar!&#8221;</p>

<p>So home, and to the office a little and then home, where I find Goodgroome, and he and I did sing several things over, and tried two or three grace parts in Playford&#8217;s new book, my wife pleasing me in singing her part of the things she knew, which is a comfort to my very heart.</p>

<p>So Abd al-Malik bin Marwan summoned them and said, &#8220;An ye plead that the accused is Jinn-mad this were folly, for he is the prince of intelligent men: I was resolved to let him life until the morrow; but I have been thwarted and this very night I will send and have him strangled.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they lighted down at their hostel, and never had Ralph seen such another, for the court within was very great and with a fair garden filled with flowers and orchard-trees, and amidst it was a fountain of fresh water, built in the goodliest fashion of many-coloured marble-stones.</p>

<p>So to White Hall, and there found the Duke and twenty more reading their commission (of which I am, and was also sent to, to come) for the Royall Fishery, which is very large, and a very serious charter it is; but the company generally so ill fitted for so serious a worke that I do much fear it will come to little.</p>

<p>So he ceased not running and the other followed after him, but being unable to catch him he returned to his guests and served them with somewhat of bread and so forth, whilst the woman kept blaming him and nagging about the matter of the geese which she said had been carried off, but which had been given by her to her lover.</p>

<p>So home to dinner, and Tom came and dined with me, and so, anon, to church again, and there a simple coxcomb preached worse than the Scot, and no Pembleton nor his wife there, which pleased me not a little, and then home and spent most of the evening at Sir W. Pen&#8217;s in complaisance, seeing him though he deserves no respect from me.</p>

<p>So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft.</p>

<p>So then, I say, from Heliopolis the land has no longer a great extent so far as it belongs to Egypt,[13] and for about four[14] days&#8217; sail up the river Egypt properly so called is narrow: and the space between the mountain-ranges which have been mentioned is plain-land, but where it is narrowest it did not seem to me to exceed two hundred furlongs from the Arabian mountains to those which are called the Libyan.</p>

<p>So spake they: idly of another&#8217;s state Babbling vain words and fond philosophy; _110 This was their consolation; such debate Men held with one another; nor did he, Like one who labours with a human woe, Decline this talk: as if its theme might be Another, not himself, he to and fro _115 Questioned and canvassed it with subtlest wit; And none but those who loved him best could know That which he knew not, how it galled and bit His weary mind, this converse vain and cold; For like an eyeless nightmare grief did sit _120 Upon his being; a snake which fold by fold Pressed out the life of life, a clinging fiend Which clenched him if he stirred with deadlier hold;-- And so his grief remained--let it remain--untold.</p>

<p>Thus he not only took a draught of more wholesome teaching with obedient mind, but wiped off early stains by his purity at the end.</p>

<h2 id="aidchapter19chapter19a"><a id="chapter19">Chapter 19</a></h2>

<p>There is a story which even you have preserved, that once upon a time Phaëthon, the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father&#8217;s chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick--March!&#8221;</p>

<p>By the importance of its acquirements, by its capital, in a word, the intelligence of one individual differs and will always differ from that of another; but, being a power equal in all at the beginning, social progress must consist in rendering it, by an ever increasing perfection of methods, again equal in all at the end.</p>

<p>Answered she:--Yes, it hath reached me that they tell a tale of THE CAT[FN#166] AND THE CROW Once upon a time, a crow and a cat lived in brotherhood; and one day as they were together under a tree, behold, they spied a leopard making towards them, and they were not aware of his approach till he was close upon them.</p>

<p>Blind obedience to the pleasure of the court cannot be without great sin, and incurring the high displeasure of the King of kings.</p>

<p>At this dispute between us there were present the treasurers and other gentlefolk commissioned by the King to superintend my proceedings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire,&#8221; replied D&#8217;Artagnan, &#8220;I have quitted the service of the king of France, making a promise to my prince not to serve any other king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also there swore King Urience, that was Sir Uwain&#8217;s father, of the land of Gore, and he would bring six thousand men of arms on horseback.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, having used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had made their salutations, the king led the way to an inner cabinet, but his progress was much impeded by the crowding of the nobles about him.</p>

<p>Marcus Valerius Laevinus was sent to the Adriatic, and pushed the king so hard that he was obliged to burn the fleet in which he intended to sail for Italy.</p>

<p>Within the next two generations, and after much fierce fighting between the adherents of the two religions, all the other kingdoms as well had been christianized.</p>

<p>Such was the purport of the King&#8217;s communications to the envoy, as appears from memoranda in the royal handwriting and from the correspondence of Margaret of Parma.</p>

<p>A week after, Hrafn the Red came thither, and told them all the tidings of Brian&#8217;s battle, the fall of the king, and of Earl Sigurd, and Brodir, and all the Vikings.</p>

<p>The previous king, Toogoo Ahoo, had been assassinated by Finow, and his soul, become an Atua of divine rank in Bolotoo, had been pleased to visit and inspire Finow&#8217;s son--with what particular object does not appear.</p>

<p>And Homer (where he says that Jupiter hated the house of Priam, and was resolved to transfer the kingdom to the family of AEneas) yet mentions nothing of his leading a colony into a foreign country and settling there.</p>

<p>Replied Abu Zarr, &#8220;By the truth of the All-Wise King, if the three days of grace expire and the young man returneth not, I will fulfill my warranty and surrender my person to the Imam;&#8221; and added Omar (whom Allah accept!</p>

<p>No, by my word;--of bands prepared To guard King James&#8217;s sports I heard; Nor doubt I aught, but, when they hear This muster of the mountaineer, Their pennons will abroad be flung, Which else in Doune had peaceful hung.&#8217;</p>

<p>Certainly it was not unreasonable for Henry to suppose that a kingdom thus torn by internal convulsions might be more open to a well organized attack, than capable of carrying out at that moment fresh projects of universal dominion.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his interview, in which the King was quite alone, Richardot asked if he would agree to maintain neutrality like the King of Spain and the Archdukes, and allow the princes to settle their business with the Emperor.</p>

<p>Great Kings of France and England: that I haue labour&#8217;d With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors, To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview; Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.</p>

<p>We were soon in presence of the King, where--under the shade of a clump of second-growth poplar-trees, with which nearly all the farms in the north of France are here and there dotted--the presentation was made in the simplest and most agreeable manner.</p>

<p>It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabsaces, whom the king of the Assyrians his master hath sent to blaspheme the living God, and to reproach with words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up by prayer for the remnant that is left.</p>

<p>on October 3rd, 1399--the &#8220;conqueror of Brut&#8217;s Albion,&#8221; otherwise King Henry IV, doubled Chaucer&#8217;s pension of twenty marks, so that, continuing as he did to enjoy the annuity of twenty pounds granted him by King Richard, he was now once more in comfortable circumstances.</p>

<p>And he was a young man, and he believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity which Abinadi has testified against them; therefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace.</p>

<p>Then the King&#8217;s eyes ran over with tears and his sickness redoubled on him; whereupon his brother in law, the Chamberlain took charge over the country and, being a capable man, he judged and bade and forbade for the whole of that year, while Zau al-Makan was occupied with his malady.</p>

<p>^69 As often as the peace of his kingdom was threatened (for it was never invaded) by the Barbarians, he removed his court to Verona ^70 on the northern frontier, and the image of his palace, still extant on a coin, represents the oldest and most authentic model of Gothic architecture.</p>

<p>When the Fatimite caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant Joseph with a gift of his royal mantle, and forty Arabian horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of Tunis and Algiers.</p>

<p>The abbess, who was the daughter of a noble house, took particular delight in stories of the court, which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom, and which, above all, have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents, at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away.</p>

<p>He says, if my Lord [Sandwich] were here, he were the fittest man to be Lord Treasurer of any man in England; and he thinks it might be compassed; for he confesses that the King&#8217;s matters do suffer through the inability of this man, who is likely to die, and he will propound him to the King.</p>

<p>And when Balin saw that spear, he gat it in his hand and turned him to King Pellam, and smote him passingly sore with that spear, that King Pellam fell down in a swoon, and therewith the castle roof and walls brake and fell to the earth, and Balin fell down so that he might &lt;71&gt;not stir foot nor hand.</p>

<p>King St. Panigon, first of the name, reigned there, and, attended by the princes his sons and the nobles of his court, came as far as the port to receive Pantagruel, and conducted him to his palace; near the gate of which the queen, attended by the princesses her daughters and the court ladies, received us.</p>

<p>So these two wicked daughters, as if they strove to exceed each other in cruelty to their old father, who had been so good to them, by little and little would have abated him of all his train, all respect (little enough for him that once commanded a kingdom), which was left him to show that he had once been a king!</p>

<p>The boy with the moon on his forehead (which he always kept concealed with a turban, lest it should attract notice) and his beautiful sister now broke up the potter&#8217;s establishment, sold his wheel and pots and pans, and went to the bazar in the King&#8217;s city, which they had no sooner entered than it was lit up brilliantly.</p>

<p>And whatsoever he required of Allah after this, in the names of the pious King and Queen, He granted it without fail and the man made thereon these couplets, &quot;My Lord hath servants fain of piety; * Hearts in the Wisdom- garden ranging free: Their bodies&#8217; lusts at peace, and motionless * For breasts that bide in purest secresy.</p>

<p>One of them was Luther&#8217;s old colleague, Carlstadt, who had returned in July from a short visit to Copenhagen, whither the King of Denmark had invited him to promote the new evangelical theology at the university, but had soon again dismissed him, and who now assumed the lead at Wittenberg with a passionate and ambitious, but undeterminate zeal.</p>

<p>Numa, yielding to these inducements, having first performed divine sacrifice, proceeded to Rome, being met in his way by the senate and people, who, with an impatient desire, came forth to receive him; the women, also, welcomed him with joyful acclamations, and sacrifices were offered for him in all the temples, and so universal was the joy, that they seemed to be receiving, not a new king, but a new kingdom.</p>

<p>[1] Watching his opportunity, [2] he said: “In the King’s name I put this man here into possession of that tennis-court, together with the lodgings that pertain to it.” To this I answered: “The sacred King is lord of all things here: so then you might have effected an entrance with more freedom: coming thus with notaries and people of the court looks more like a fraud than the mandate of a powerful monarch.</p>

<p>Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters: I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness; I never gave you kingdom, call&#8217;d you children; You owe me no subscription: then let fall Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave, A poor, infirm, weak, and despis&#8217;d old man:-- But yet I call you servile ministers, That will with two pernicious daughters join Your high-engender&#8217;d battles &#8217;gainst a head So old and white as this!</p>

<p>Thence to my tailor&#8217;s and a mercer&#8217;s for patterns to carry my wife of cloth and silk for a bed, which I think will please her and me, and so home, and fitted myself for my journey to-morrow, which I fear will not be pleasant, because of the wet weather, it raining very hard all this day; but the less it troubles me because the King and Duke of York and Court are at this day at Newmarket, at a great horse-race, and proposed great pleasure for two or three days, but are in the same wet.</p>

<p>[3] It is indeed great glory for me that my works are held in such repute among you wealthy lords; but I can assure you that during these many years past I have been progressing in my art with all my might, and I think that the vase I am taking with me into France is far more worthy of cardinals and kings than that piece belonging to your little quack doctor.” After I had made this speech, Messer Alfonso seemed dying with desire to see the jug and basin, but I refused to open the box.</p>

<p>Up, and, being desired by a messenger from Sir G. Carteret, I by water over to Southwarke, and so walked to the Falkon, on the Bank-side, and there got another boat, and so to Westminster, where I would have gone into the Swan; but the door was locked; and the girl could not let me in, and so to Wilkinson&#8217;s in King Street, and there wiped my shoes, and so to Court, where sermon not yet done I met with Brisband; and he tells me, first, that our business of tickets did come to debate yesterday, it seems, after I was gone away, and was voted a miscarriage in general.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>

<p>Presently said Kanmakan, &#8220;Whither dost thou now intend?&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently he found it--a crumpled bit of yellow paper.</p>

<p>Presently, the dock became the central point of interest.</p>

<p>Presently I heard it nearer--in the scullery, as I judged.</p>

<p>Presently he collapsed, sitting hopelessly, nervelessly in his chair.</p>

<p>Presently an officer left the door of the inn and spoke to the soldiers.</p>

<p>Presently D&#8217;Arnot stopped at a page on which were five tiny little smudges.</p>

<p>Presently his host brought the chess and said to him, &quot;Wilt thou play with me?</p>

<p>Presently, Chenet began to relate stories of death that appeared comical to him.</p>

<p>Presently he came to the market-place, and beheld thereon three gallows erected.</p>

<p>Presently Hasan Shuman came out of a closet and said to him, &#8220;Hast thou gotten the gear, O Ali?&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently I heard the diminishing sound of whirring propellers and realized that again I was safe.</p>

<p>Presently the governor drew his chair to the table, and motioned Councillor Drayton and Iberville to be seated.</p>

<p>Presently, the contagion spread; though, upon strict examination of the evidence, not nearly so far as was supposed.</p>

<p>Presently Foka entered the room, but, on seeing our emotion and not wishing to disturb us, stopped short at the door.</p>

<p>Presently Partridge, who could not see the joke, made London laugh by his frantic attempts to prove that he was alive.</p>

<p>Presently Iberville, with a winning smile, ran an arm over his shoulder and added: &#8220;We cannot go without you, Dollier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently he named the boy Sídí Nur al-Din Ali and reared him in fondness and delight among the hand-maids and thralls.</p>

<p>Presently a clattering of hoofs was heard, and looking toward the sound, I perceived the Chancellor cantering down the road.</p>

<p>Presently I heard myself answering in a voice that I hardly recognized, &quot;--They&#8217;re confoundedly particular about morality in these parts.</p>

<p>Presently his fingers ceased their play; his eyes popped wider than ever as they fastened upon the door through which Thurid had disappeared.</p>

<p>Presently the king&#8217;s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.</p>

<p>Presently the violence of her sobbing diminished and she sat in the chair, exhausted, with her head thrown back and her arms hanging by her side.</p>

<p>Presently the tears came into her eyes, and she got up and went to the window, as though she were afraid that her uncle might wake and see them.</p>

<p>Presently they departed to their own country, when my father&#8217;s wife came and opened the tomb and drew me forth and we returned together to our home.</p>

<p>Presently one of the crew spied the approaching Claytons, and with a cry of: &#8220;Here&#8217;s two more for the fishes,&#8221; rushed toward them with uplifted ax.</p>

<p>Presently, preparations were made for the wedding of Prince Rostam, and the tailor with whom Badialzaman lodged was ordered to prepare the fairy&#8217;s robes.</p>

<p>Presently, the Queen arose and taking Badr Basim by the hand, sat down with him on chairs and bade bring food, whereof they ate, and washed their hands.</p>

<p>Presently arrived the handmaid of the alcalde with a basket, which she took into the kitchen, where she prepared an excellent supper for her master&#8217;s friend.</p>

<p>Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in: Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota, Iowa, Indiana, and Vermont.</p>

<p>Presently my brother rose and went out to obey a call of nature, but the old woman overtook him, and said, &#8220;Be patient a little and thou shalt win to thy wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the black warriors began to strike farther and farther south into the heart of the forest when they went to hunt, looking for a site for a new village.</p>

<p>Presently the old woman returned to the lover and said, &quot;Know thou that I have engineered the affair for thee with her; and now we must mend that we have marred.</p>

<p>Presently the Princess entered the garden with her damsels and with the old woman, who said to herself, &#8220;If these eunuchs stay with us, we shall not attain our end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the steamer drew to a wharf, and, with a loud clattering, firewood was dragged forth and cast into the stokehole with uncouth, warning cries of &#8220; Tru-us-sha! &#8221;</p>

<p>Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat&#8217;s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.</p>

<p>Presently Ralph turned to Roger and spake to him somewhat sourly, and said: &quot;Thou hadst one lie in thy mouth and didst swallow it; but how shall I know that another did not come out thence?</p>

<p>Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, attentively regarding myself.</p>

<p>Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb&#8217;s whale.</p>

<p>Presently Kemeriyeh and her sister [Wekhimeh] came up to their grandfather and told him what they had done; whereupon he came to Tuhfeh and saluted her and gave her joy of her deliverance.</p>

<p>Presently, Janshah, seeing that the Ghuls were getting the better of the apes, cried out to his men, saying, &#8216;Unease your bows and arrows and shoot at them your best shafts and keep them off from us.&#8217;</p>

<p>Presently the holy man turned to the merchant and seeing him changed of colour and conduct asked him, &#8220;What is with thee to do, and what ill hast thou to rue that thy case and complexion are so changed to view?&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently came Charley, lightly winding among the bushes and tripping along the paths, as rosy and pretty as one of Flora&#8217;s attendants instead of my maid, saying, &quot;Oh, if you please, miss, would you step and speak to Mr.</p>

<p>Presently she said to the servingwoman, who used to bring her the food, &#8220;Speak the king that he return to his women, for he hath no need of me, and I desire to abide in this place, so I may worship therein Allah the Most High.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in: Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently, about 2 A. M., as near as I can remember, we observed it settling very rapidly, with the bows and the bridge completely under water, and concluded it was now only a question of minutes before it went; and so it proved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently I went up to it and digging therein suddenly came upon a crock[FN#242] full of gold wherefrom I took ten ashrafis, the value of the bull, and returned it to its place, saying, &#8220;Allah ensure thy weal, O Mother of Solomon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the ladies, also came out, and after a little discussions as to seats and the safety of the girls (all of which seemed to me wholly superfluous), they settled themselves in the vehicle, opened their parasols, and started.</p>

<p>Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in: Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in: Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>Presently the youth arose and stripping off his outer dress placed a scymitar between them and lay upon the bed beside the Princess;[FN#145] and he did no villain deed, for it sufficed him to prevent the consummation of her nuptials with the Wazir&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple of his ragged Offal Court comrades--one of them the lord high admiral in his late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the same pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever.</p>

<p>Presently they came across a big one upon the top most boughs and tried to swarm up the trunk and carry it off, but by reason of their lack of strength and little practice they durst not venture so high; whereupon they bade a slave boy who ever attended on them, climb the tree.</p>

<p>Presently, he heard a band of drums beating and hid himself in a shop, till the slave-girls came up, when he looked at them; and, seeing the young lady riding amongst them, love and longing overcame him and desire and distraction overpowered him, so that he had no force to stand.</p>

<p>Presently, as I went along, behold, I saw a number of people approaching me and turned aside into another path to avoid them; but seeing that I wore a turband in preacher-fashion,[FN#419] they followed me and hastening up to me, said, &#8216;Knowest thou the lodging of Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi?&#8217;</p>

<p>Presently I called my companions and as soon as they all rejoined me, said to them &#8217;Look at yonder basin behind this mountain; for I see therein a city high of base and a strong-cornered place girt with sconce and rampartry, pasturage and lea and doubtless it wanteth not water and good things.</p>

<p>Presently the Judge lay down and was drowned in slumber and knew not what Allah had destined to him from the plans and projects of the girl who, rising up at midnight, opened the door of her chamber leading into the saloon where the Kazi al-&#8217;Askar kept all his hoards and coin[FN#429] and dresses and belongings.</p>

<p>Presently it so happened that the girl&#8217;s owner entered the school about the same time and, finding the tablet, read the above verses indited by the boy, the girl and the schoolmaster; and wrote under them these two couplets, &quot;May Allah never make you parting dree * And be your censurer shamed wearily!</p>

<p>Presently Kurajan seized the Moslem by the jerkin under his hauberk and, dragging him from his saddle, dashed him to the ground where he left him; upon which the Kafirs laid hands on him and bound him and bore him off to their tents; whilst Kurajan wheeled about and careered and offered battle, till another captain came out, whom also he took prisoner; nor did he leave to do thus till he had made prize of seven captains before mid day.</p>

<p>Presently they brought her to the fireside, very much confused, and very shy, - but she soon became more assured when she found how gently and respectfully Steerforth spoke to her; how skilfully he avoided anything that would embarrass her; how he talked to Mr. Peggotty of boats, and ships, and tides, and fish; how he referred to me about the time when he had seen Mr. Peggotty at Salem House; how delighted he was with the boat and all belonging to it; how lightly and easily he carried on, until he brought us, by degrees, into a charmed circle, and we were all talking away without any reserve.</p>

<p>I have just to copy the end.</p>

<p>Not very far from a town where dwelt the king lived once upon a time a farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well said!&#8221;</p>

<p>said McGinty.</p>

<p>One said, &#8220;La!&#8221;</p>

<p>he said breaking off.</p>

<p>I do,&quot; said Vittoria.</p>

<p>said Nicholas earnestly.</p>

<p>said Fouquet, with a sigh.</p>

<p>I am sure he would,&quot; said I.</p>

<p>Indeed,&quot; said Mrs. Hurstwood.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s my uncle&#8217;s idea,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Our camp will move on,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>But come to me now,&quot; said Levin.</p>

<p>she said, as soon as she could speak.</p>

<p>I must tell you something,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He swore he had not,&quot; said Mrs. Vansuythen.</p>

<p>Now we are at Hassel&#8217;s,&quot; said my companion.</p>

<p>The prince was said to be in person at Bethune.</p>

<p>Oh, sir,&#8220; she said, &#8221;I&#8217;ve seen little George.</p>

<p>Judges,&#8220; he said, &#8221;there can be but one verdict.</p>

<p>It is not so, nor it was not so,&quot; said Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>He ought to have a little water,&quot; said Nekhludoff.</p>

<p>You are so muddy,&#8217; she said, in distaste, but gently.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t seem to be made the same way you are,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#8217;m going,&quot; said Anna, rousing herself and getting up.</p>

<p>It is said in some quarters that we are not prepared for war.</p>

<p>he said, and that question embarrassed them all considerably.</p>

<p>Emilia replied: &#8220;I have not said so,&#8221; with exasperating coolness.</p>

<p>She was flattered in being the sole confidante, and said no more.</p>

<p>No,&quot; said Smith, tugging reflectively at the lobe of his left ear.</p>

<p>28 But who then, said I, are those, who went into the tower crowned?</p>

<p>&#8220;O my brother,&#8221; said I, &#8220;for Allah&#8217;s sake do what I want and go thy gait!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Verily, lord,&#8221; said one, &#8220;it was an insult unto thee, and as such was it meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>said the Emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.</p>

<p>O King,&#8220; they said, &#8221;our hearts were filled with fear Lest evil had befallen thee.</p>

<p>Stay with me; I guarantee your fortunes,--three months ago I would not have said that.</p>

<p>I would not hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is no knowing how anything may turn out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, madam,&#8221; said Allworthy, &#8220;I have been abused by the person, whoever he was, that told you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did his bidding and set the beggar before his whilome comrade who said to him, &#8220;Dost thou know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>How can you dare,&#8217; said she with angry look, &#8217;descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief?</p>

<p>All of us, as we afterwards remarked to one another, had an unpleasant feeling at hearing what they said.</p>

<p>tis very well,&#8220; said Miss Jenny; &#8221;I see it is in vain to attempt that flinty heart of his by fair means.</p>

<p>27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?</p>

<p>So he rose in wrath[FN#88] and went in to Rayya, who said to him, &#8220;O my papa, why do I see thee show anger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Don Quixote; &#8220;but at present I am not aware that I have got anything of yours, Master Pedro.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Collot once said to me, &quot;If he had asked me for as much money as would have built a frigate he should have had it.</p>

<p>At the thame time,&#8217; said Sleary, &#8217;I mutht put in my word, Thquire, tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen.</p>

<p>It has also been said that the single tax would force into productive use land which is now being held for speculative purposes.</p>

<p>I see no sin in being able to ride well on horseback,&#8220; said the Theatin; &#8221;that is in perfect good taste, and does honor to our gown.</p>

<p>That one,&#8220; said the captain, &#8221;is of course the Christian&quot;; by which name the Spaniards style their own language in contradistinction to all others.</p>

<p>After grace was said, and while the servants clattered in with the meat platters, Robin stood up and said: &quot;An amen say I to my lord Bishop&#8217;s thanks!</p>

<p>The sheik had been a silent, but not unsympathetic, witness of the young man&#8217;s suffering; now he arose and said, &quot;Son of Arrius, it is for me to beg thy pardon.</p>

<p>Good morrow, gentlemen, said Panurge; good morrow to you all; you are in very good health, thanks to heaven and yourselves; you are all heartily welcome, and in good time.</p>

<p>El Abbas did this and the merchant rejoiced in his neighbourhood and left him not night nor day, so that the prince said to him, &#8220;By Allah, I distract thee from thy livelihood.&#8221;</p>

<p>The people were crying aloud, she said, that the Spanish inquisition, or a worse than Spanish inquisition, had been established among them by means of bishops and ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>Said the sharper, &#8220;I can do nothing of the kind;&#8221; and, confessing himself beaten, returned him his sandal-wood and redeemed himself from him with an hundred sequins, to be off his bargain.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am very sorry,&#8217; said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, &#8217;but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.</p>

<p>[Footnote *: The passage quoted by Gibbon is not taken from the writings of Zoroaster, but from the Sadder, a work, as has been before said, much later than the books which form the Zendavesta.</p>

<p>When the mate came forward, he talked to the men, and said we should be on George&#8217;s Bank before to-morrow noon; and joked with the boys, promising to go and see them, and to take them down to Marblehead in a coach.</p>

<p>It is said that the works on this Island are in bad repair, on account of being so Extensive that they would take more men to Defend them than they could spare, and, placing no Dependancy on their Strength, let them go to decay.</p>

<p>The Wazir, seeing that he did thus but because he was parted from his brother, went to tell the King, who said, &#8220;If this, which is but a beast, cannot brook to be parted from his brother, how should it be with those that have reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>He wished, as he said in the introduction, since he could not personally appear at the Diet, at least to be among them in writing with this his &#8216;dumb and weak message;&#8217; which he had expressed, however, in the strongest and most forcible language at his command.</p>

<p>At last, when we had passed a couple of hours or so, very agreeably, he suddenly took up his hat, and leaning over the table and looking me full in the face, said, in a low voice: &quot;Weel, Misther, we&#8217;ve been vara pleasant toogather, and ar&#8217;ll spak&#8217; my moind tiv&#8217;ee.</p>

<p>&#8220;That thou mayst recognize,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the school Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far Its doctrine follows after my discourse, And mayst behold your path from the divine Distant as far as separated is From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he sent a messenger to her to say that it was a far better thing to be the wife of the King of Leinster than to be the wife of the son of the King of Connaught, for a king is better than a prince, and Ivell thought that this was as wise a thing as anybody had ever said.</p>

<p>None answered till a big and burly man rose up and said: &quot;Nay, Tall Thomas, thou hast said and done all that need was, and I deem that time presses; wherefore my mind is that we now break up this mote, and that after we have eaten a morsel we get ourselves into due array and take to the road.</p>

<p>Indeed, madam, said I, he has been pleased to give me a most noble lecture; and I find he was angry with me in earnest, and that it will not be an easy task to behave unexceptionably to him: for he is very nice and delicate in his notions, I perceive; but yet, as your ladyship says, exceeding generous.</p>

<p>Evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones: &#8220;I imagine, sir,&#8221; said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, &quot;that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it&#8217;s best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia.</p>

<p>About noon the chapmen came back again well pleased; and Clement gave Ralph a parchment from the lord, which bade all men help and let pass Ralph of Upmeads, as a sergeant of the chapmen&#8217;s guard, and said withal that now he was free to go about the town if he listed, so that he were back at the hostel of the Fleece by nightfall.</p>

<p>When he was departed, his sister expressed more bitterness (if possible) against him than she had done while he was present; for the truth of which she appealed to Mr Blifil, who, with great complacence, acquiesced entirely in all she said; but excused all the faults of Mr Western, &#8220;as they must be considered,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to have proceeded from the too inordinate fondness of a father, which must be allowed the name of an amiable weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or inability, both of the President and Vice-President, declaring what officer shall then act as President, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected.</p>

<p>These three manifestations,--the fugitive-slave law, the Dred Scott decision, and the anarchy in Kansas,--though they were revolting in the extreme and indescribably painful, hastened the end.</p>

<p>BRIAR ROSE A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off, where there were in those days fairies.</p>

<p>I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saved him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d kill him!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was never mad.</p>

<p>I was very busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen him.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I will see to that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m an honest man.</p>

<p>I will tell you why.</p>

<p>I feel it in my bones.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall undertake it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I and the Father are one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell thee no; it cannot be.&#8221;</p>

<p>I dismissed my maid at Chester.</p>

<p>I was a girl not very long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at your service, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all crowded up and shivery.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was merciless, but am pitiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it deuced civil of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am come to cast fire on the earth.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like novels that end happily.</p>

<p>(I thought it best to treat him so.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve hardly any money and no prospects.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told them: `It&#8217;s for the elephant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do with my evenings.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had reached one bound of my watery prison.</p>

<p>I rise to a point of ordher under the rules!</p>

<p>I do,&quot; said Mr. Boythorn with great vigour.</p>

<p>I. Ali Baba and the Forty Robbers, 19-Pt.</p>

<p>I see you know my name,&quot; she said, when she came.</p>

<p>I have set on&#8217;t, and when I&#8217;m set on&#8217;t I must do&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.</p>

<p>I dressed hurriedly and met the professor at the Traveler&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll--&#8217; &#8217;Yes, make another will--or else alter that one.</p>

<p>I wish for no better, sir,&quot; said she with something of dignity.</p>

<p>I am still a very young man -- not yet twenty-two years of age.</p>

<p>I am come that they may have life and may have it more abundantly.</p>

<p>I have heard them call me in the night; I have seen them on the water walking.</p>

<p>I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing.</p>

<p>I must now leave Sapt and his friends, and relate how I myself proceeded on this eventful night.</p>

<p>I afterwards saw this dreadful place, also a legacy from the prehistoric people who lived in Kôr.</p>

<p>I have seen the meteors of fashions rise and fall, without any attempt to add a moment to their duration.</p>

<p>I had little hope that he could best his giant adversary who had mowed down all before him during the day.</p>

<p>I have never noticed anything that would make me consider him pro-German, though of course he is pro-Marx.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run down to the Cromarty Arms, and order a cab to carry us away at once from this inhospitable sham castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not claim that I am any less so than the average of men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than Judge Douglas.</p>

<p>I could not, however, find a safe opportunity of escaping by sea, and found myself obliged again to draw towards the North.</p>

<p>I would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old lady&#8217;s confidence if I could have possibly declined it.</p>

<p>I could not admit the thought, remembering what had passed between us, and the tone of voice in which he had called her by her name.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said Flosi, &#8220;when I gave away my brother&#8217;s daughter to thee, that thou gavest me thy word to stand by me in every suit.&#8221;</p>

<p>I continued watching the enemy till I saw the match placed at the touch-hole of their piece; at that very instant I gave the signal for our gun to be fired also.</p>

<p>I knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch--&quot; began the prince, and paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at his betraying no surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would too that thou shouldst be with me in my journeyings, as thou art a sharpsighted, swiftfooted man, and besides I think thou wouldst be dauntless in an onslaught.&#8221;</p>

<p>I staggered back towards the table - my hand fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet - and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul.</p>

<p>I had been familiar, in Kansas, with the metaphor by which the sentiments of an owner were credited to his property, and had heard of a proslavery colt and an antislavery cow.</p>

<p>I have heard that when he married my aunt, and that was when he was about your age, he had the best stud in the whole county; and then he was in Parliament before he was three-and-twenty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, Mr. Fogg,&#8221; replied Aouda; &#8220;and I ask you in my turn, will you forgive me for having followed you, and--who knows?--for having, perhaps, delayed you, and thus contributed to your ruin?&#8221;</p>

<p>I have been reluctantly led to the same opinion, and in justice to my countrymen who have suffered wrongs from Mexico and who may still suffer them I feel bound to announce this conclusion to Congress.</p>

<p>I consulted the good Doctor relative to an absence of three days; and the Doctor wishing me to take that relaxation, - he wished me to take more; but my energy could not bear that, - I made up my mind to go.</p>

<p>I was extremely provoked at this insolence, and told him, it could not be supposed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the sword at his own weapon; but I was persuaded he would wrestle or box with him.</p>

<p>I am sure this is one of the most extraordinary geographical features on the face of the earth, for, as I have said, it is composed of several enormous rounded stone shapes, like the backs of several monstrous kneeling pink elephants.</p>

<p>I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter.</p>

<p>I am bound to admit, natheless,&#8220; he added graciously, &#8221;that he, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>I am, indeed, in some doubt that I have often suffered by the contrary method; and that, by suppressing the original author&#8217;s name, I have been rather suspected of plagiarism than reputed to act from the amiable motive assigned by that justly celebrated Frenchman.</p>

<p>I have understood that Belinus and Brenius, kings of Britain, have had the empire in their hands many days, and also Constantine the son of Heleine, which is an open evidence that we owe no tribute to Rome but of right we that be descended of them have right to claim the title of the empire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare to say that you, my dear father, you and all my family, do great injustice to the king, my husband; and I trust the time will come when you will be convinced that you have done him injustice, and then you will ever find in him, as well as in myself, the most respectful and affectionate of children.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you.</p>

<p>I was shown the house, the kitchen and heating arrangements, the barns with their fine stock, the various manufacturing operations; and in the evening was taken to their daily gathering, at which instrumental music, singing, and conversation engage them for an hour, after which they disperse to the private parlors to amuse themselves with dominoes or dancing, or to the library to read or write letters.</p>

<p>Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: You that eat with the blood and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses, and that shed blood: shall you possess the land by inheritance?</p>

<p>Therefore he must keep together those brave warriors, to whom with heaven&#8217;s help the victory was due, and he must take all care that they did not lose their valour, hardihood, and skill.</p>

<p>Therefore quoth every one of those present to the woman, &#8220;Allah upon thee, leave this sinful obstinacy and recognise the right of this matter, lest haply thy husband and the father of thy children die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore when they see that these things are good, Thou seest that they are good; and whatsoever things for Thy sake please, Thou pleasest in them, and what through Thy Spirit please us, they please Thee in us.</p>

<p>Therefore the best among them stood on a moral level that is not often reached, while the worst were far below the ordinary level, many of them being untruthful, hypocritical and at the same time self-satisfied and proud.</p>

<p>Therefore the bruit of them for generosity and liberality went abroad throughout the city and won for them notable name and the fairest of fame; nor did any ever speak of aught save the beneficence of Zayn al-Asnam and his generosity and his opulence.</p>

<p>Therefore, all the substances that compose the body of this earth must exist there in a state of incandescent gas; for the metals that most resist the action of heat, gold, and platinum, and the hardest rocks, can never be either solid or liquid under such a temperature.</p>

<p>Therefore, &#8217;tis necessary for you to decide now, whether to be utterly ruined, yourselves and your children, or to continue firmly the work which you have begun boldly, and rather to die a hundred thousand deaths than to make a treaty with them, which can only end in your ruin.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir Launcelot, wit thou well I am set in such a plight to get my soul-heal; and yet I trust through God&#8217;s grace that after my death to have a sight of the blessed face of Christ, and at domesday to sit on his right side, for as sinful as ever I was are saints in heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore I pray you, consider whether you will sit down contented with small things and share the fruits of my industry in peace, till Providence shall send better tidings; or, by your despair, plunge both our souls and bodies into everlasting perdition, which God of his infinite mercy forbid!&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the brooks, and to the valleys, and to desolate places, and ruinous walls, and to the cities that are forsaken, that are spoiled, and derided by the rest of the nations round about.</p>

<p>Therefore to Armes, be Champion of our Church, Or let the Church our mother breathe her curse, A mothers curse, on her reuolting sonne: France, thou maist hold a serpent by the tongue, A cased Lion by the mortall paw, A fasting Tyger safer by the tooth, Then keepe in peace that hand which thou dost hold Fra.</p>

<p>Therefore, we believe that he lived in the times of the apostles, and received from them, as he says that he did, the facts that he recorded in his Gospel; that he was the traveling companion and missionary helper of Paul, as he intimates that he was, and that he has given us a true account of the life and work of that great apostle.</p>

<p>Therefore this fact struck my notice with that curious force with which little things do strike us when our minds are absolutely overwhelmed by a sudden rush of powerful sensations; beaten flat, as it were, like a sea beneath the first burst of a hurricane, so that every little object on the surface starts into an unnatural prominence.</p>

<p>Therefore, I strongly recommend that action be taken at this Session on such wholly Federal projects as the Colorado River Storage Project and the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project; on the John Day partnership project, and other projects which provide for cooperative action between the Federal Government and non-Federal interests; and on legislation, which makes provision for Federal participation in small projects under the primary sponsorship of agencies of State and local government.</p>

<p>You may so in the end.-- My mother told me just how he would woo, As if she sat in&#8217;s heart; she says all men Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me When his wife&#8217;s dead; therefore I&#8217;ll lie with him When I am buried.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII PWYLL, PRINCE OF DYVED Once upon a time Pwyll was at Narberth, his chief palace, where a feast had been prepared for him, and with him was a great host of men.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are free.&#8221;</p>

<p>You frighten me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an angel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You astonish me!&#8221;</p>

<p>You surely know it.</p>

<p>You got to stay always.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t mean chimneys?&#8217;</p>

<p>You men will never tarry.</p>

<p>You are restless, my son?&#8217;</p>

<p>You wretch--you wretch!</p>

<p>You go and tramp,&#8217; he ses.</p>

<p>You are late,&quot; I remarked.</p>

<p>You could be free instantly.</p>

<p>You look very ill, Nicholas.</p>

<p>You remember what happened, eh?</p>

<p>You will not owne it Her.</p>

<p>You were going to say something.</p>

<p>You have forgotten him, perhaps!</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to help you out, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>You are wet, and you look weary.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can serve as a spy, Wilfrid!&#8221;</p>

<p>You see, she is quite like a child.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re helping me treat an invalid.</p>

<p>You seem a sprightly, energetic man.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll know it quite well before long.</p>

<p>You go so much backward when you fight.</p>

<p>You see how curiously theological it is.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been back a month, have you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very like Lizabetha Prokofievna.&#8221;</p>

<p>You have failed in your duty at Aranjuez.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are engaged to him, a plighted woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>You charge me That I have blown this coal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the means, then, of touching him?&#8221;</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t care for going on a launch, then?&#8217;</p>

<p>You will allow him to be a fine judge of women.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get any furlough for shooting that!&#8221;</p>

<p>You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise.</p>

<p>You loved me - then what RIGHT had you to leave me?</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve plenty of pennies now,&quot; she said soothingly.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll never be of age, you silly old man,&quot; Becky replied.</p>

<p>You see Nils was by no means so good yet as he ought to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no occasion to come here to learn that, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>You would have thought it was merely another of my failures.</p>

<p>You seem to find her attractive yourself,&quot; laughed the officer.</p>

<p>You have given in your resignation; shall I refuse to accept it?</p>

<p>You shall go up and down and round the town in a taxi every day.</p>

<p>You have reviled my mother, and I will go hence and tell her of it.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve not come here for to make me suppose that he wants to marry HER?</p>

<p>You are mine, my Clara--utterly mine; every thought, every feeling.</p>

<p>You set him up as a politician, to be knocked down, to a dead certainty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have played so many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.&#8221;</p>

<p>You see, sir, nobody can possibly believe that such a man as that stole twenty pounds.&#8217;</p>

<p>You couldn&#8217;t name a better country, by Hercules, you couldn&#8217;t, if only the men had any brains.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will, of course, charge ordinary prices--proper market prices; European prices, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>You are a conscientious man, Mr. Garth--a man, I trust, who feels himself accountable to God.</p>

<p>You can trust us to look after that, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said Lestrade, as the whole party moved towards the door.</p>

<p>`You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn&#8217;t count how many he took: contrariwise.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know me, Mohican; not a Huron of them all shall cross the swell, into your rear, without the notice of &#8216;killdeer&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You be there and want a fourth who shall be a person of good sense and prudence; smart witted, and one apt to keep careful counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>You see what Mischiefe, and what Murther too, Hath beene enacted through your enmitie: Then be at peace, except ye thirst for blood Winch.</p>

<p>You understand me very well; you knew that I stood in need of it; you knew very well that I was not master; you knew very well that my hope was in the future.</p>

<p>You will need medicine to rub on yourself when the chief gets through with you,&quot; said the young man who had discovered that Unktomi was impersonating White Plume.</p>

<p>You put that in a parlour window,&#8217; said Traddles, falling a little back from it to survey it with the greater admiration, &#8217;with a plant in it, and - and there you are!</p>

<p>You have criticised in a kindly spirit--I had almost said with partiality for the writer-- a work which teaches a doctrine that you thought it your duty to condemn.</p>

<p>You will be informed by the report from the Treasury Department of the measures taken under the act of the last session authorizing the reissue of Treasury notes in lieu of those then outstanding.</p>

<p>You tell us, and it is recorded, that Commudus, the Roman emperor, could shoot with a bow so dexterously that at a good distance he would let fly an arrow through a child&#8217;s fingers and never touch them.</p>

<p>You had better tell us at once, that that fellow Slackbridge is not in the town, stirring up the people to mutiny; and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people: that is, a most confounded scoundrel.</p>

<p>You must know, with your wide experience of turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse&#8217;s ham, and to do it subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace.</p>

<p>You are such purity that....&quot; He took her hand and did not kiss it (to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper); he merely squeezed it with a penitent air, looking at her brightening eyes.</p>

<p>I opened a little mahogany desk with brass trimmings, which was placed between the two windows, in hope of finding some ink and paper; but all I found was a quill-pen, very much worn, and chewed at the end.</p>
